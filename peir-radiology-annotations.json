CT is done is to rule out abscess or possible perforated viscus. No prior abdominal CTs for comparison.  The liver has a markedly diffuse, heterogeneous parenchymal density with large regions in the anterior and posterior aspects of the right liver lobe which are diffusely hypodense persistently even on delayed images. This appearance raises the possibility of hepatic necrosis. In the enhancing regions, there is a diffuse punctate heterogeneity which is suggestive of hepatic cirrhosis. There are multiple, small gallstones in the region of the gallbladder neck. Common duct appears non-dilated. There is diffuse circumferential gastrointestinal wall thickening from the visualized portions of the lower esophagus inferiorly to the rectum. This is most prominent in the stomach and duodenal regions. There is a small amount of ascites, noted most around the anterior aspect of the right liver lobe and in the pelvis. A moderate degree of fluid is present in the anterior pararenal space predominantly in a peripancreatic distribution and extending into the bilateral anterior pararenal fascial locations and more prominently in the right ascending colonic region. There is diffuse increased mesenteric streaky changes consistent with congestion. An umbilical varix is identified.  Liver cirrhosis is characterized by a generalized disorganization of hepatic archictecture with scarring and nodule formation. Other sequelae include liver cell damage, regenerative activity, and generalized fibrosis resulting in a nodular pattern. There is an increased incidence of hepatocelluar carcinoma associated with cirrhosis of the liver. Causes of cirrhosis include prolonged alcohol intake, viral hepatitis, biliary obstruction, Wilsons disease, and heart failure with long-standing chronic passive congestion of the liver. Alcoholic (Laennecs, nutritional) cirrhosis is the most frequently occurring form of the disorder. Clinical manifestations of the disease include jaundice, hypoalbuminemia, coagulation factor deficiencies, hyperstrinism, and intrahepatic scarring with increased portal venous pressure. The increase in portal venous pressure can lead to esophageal varices, rectal hemorrhiods, periumbilical venous collaterals (caput medusae), and splenomegaly. Morphologically, the liver may be enlarged or small and shrunken depending upon the progression of the disease. The nodular pattern is most often micronodular in alcoholic cirrhosis. Hepatic architecture is obscured by fibrous bands surrounding nodules of distorted liver cell plates. The fibrous bands contain proliferating bile ducts and inflammatory cells. In the final stages of cirrhosis the nodules become larger and more irregular resulting in a scarred, shrunken liver referred to as a \"hobnail liver\". Patients with cirrhosis of the liver often present with the following radiological findings. Fatty infiltration with hepatomegaly can be seen in the early stages of cirrhosis. Other characteristic findings include non-uniform attenuation due to chronic fatty infiltration and irregular fibrosis, irregular lobulated hepatic contour due to areas of atrophy and nodular regeneration, intrahepatic regenerating nodules, atrophy of the right lobe and hypertrophy of the left and caudate lobes, decreased liver volume accompanying chronic cirrhosis, increased size and prominence of the intrahepatic fissure due to shrunken liver parenchyma, signs of portal hypertension, and ascites. A ratio comparing the sizes of the caudate lobe and right lobe is a good diagnostic indicator of patients with cirrhosis. The caudate is measured transversely from the medial aspect of the caudate to the lateral aspect of the main portal vein. The right lobe is measured from this same point at the portal vein to the right lateral margin of the liver. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio greater than 0.65 provides 96% confidence in the diagnosis of cirrhosis. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio less then 0.6 makes cirrhosis unlikely, whereas a ratio of 0.37 is the average for normal livers.", "image_path": ["00133442.jpg"], "split": "train"}, {"id": "00134496.jpg", "report": "RADIOLOGY: GASTROINTESTINAL: GI:  OBSTRUCTING SIQMOID CANCER.  44 year old male with abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.

This patient is a 51 year old male with a history of pancreatitis and pancreatic pseudocyst.  Comparison is made with the patients prior CT four months ago. The liver is diffusely low in attenuation consistent with fatty infiltration. There is an area of scar in the right lobe of the liver. This area was seen on the prior studies as an area of low attenuation in the right lobe. It is better defined today because of the fatty infiltration. No intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation is seen. There is no ascites seen on todays study. Multiple varices are present in the gastrohepatic ligament and splenic hilum.  Liver cirrhosis is characterized by a generalized disorganization of hepatic archictecture with scarring and nodule formation. Other sequelae include liver cell damage, regenerative activity, and generalized fibrosis resulting in a nodular pattern. There is an increased incidence of hepatocelluar carcinoma associated with cirrhosis of the liver. Causes of cirrhosis include prolonged alcohol intake, viral hepatitis, biliary obstruction, Wilsons disease, and heart failure with long-standing chronic passive congestion of the liver. Alcoholic (Laennecs, nutritional) cirrhosis is the most frequently occurring form of the disorder. Clinical manifestations of the disease include jaundice, hypoalbuminemia, coagulation factor deficiencies, hyperstrinism, and intrahepatic scarring with increased portal venous pressure. The increase in portal venous pressure can lead to esophageal varices, rectal hemorrhiods, periumbilical venous collaterals (caput medusae), and splenomegaly. Morphologically, the liver may be enlarged or small and shrunken depending upon the progression of the disease. The nodular pattern is most often micronodular in alcoholic cirrhosis. Hepatic architecture is obscured by fibrous bands surrounding nodules of distorted liver cell plates. The fibrous bands contain proliferating bile ducts and inflammatory cells. In the final stages of cirrhosis the nodules become larger and more irregular resulting in a scarred, shrunken liver referred to as a \"hobnail liver\". Patients with cirrhosis of the liver often present with the following radiological findings. Fatty infiltration with hepatomegaly can be seen in the early stages of cirrhosis. Other characteristic findings include non-uniform attenuation due to chronic fatty infiltration and irregular fibrosis, irregular lobulated hepatic contour due to areas of atrophy and nodular regeneration, intrahepatic regenerating nodules, atrophy of the right lobe and hypertrophy of the left and caudate lobes, decreased liver volume accompanying chronic cirrhosis, increased size and prominence of the intrahepatic fissure due to shrunken liver parenchyma, signs of portal hypertension, and ascites. A ratio comparing the sizes of the caudate lobe and right lobe is a good diagnostic indicator of patients with cirrhosis. The caudate is measured transversely from the medial aspect of the caudate to the lateral aspect of the main portal vein. The right lobe is measured from this same point at the portal vein to the right lateral margin of the liver. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio greater than 0.65 provides 96% confidence in the diagnosis of cirrhosis.

Carcinoma of the rectosigmoid colon usually presents in an annular manner, often producing early bowel obstruction. Carcinoma of the right colon, however, usually does not obstruct early and frequently presents with iron deficiency anemia secondary to chronic blood loss.

Hemangiomas are a common incidental finding on routine imaging surveys of the liver and may pose an important diagnostic problem in patients with a known primary malignancy. Hemangiomas are the most common benign tumors of the liver. They are usually found in the right hepatic lobe and are frequently subcapsular in location. The CT appearance of hemangiomas after a bolus injection of iodinated contrast material with dynamic scanning demonstrates a dense peripheral enhancement, which eccentrically fills in toward the center of the lesion on delayed scan. This is the most common finding and is seen in approximately 85% of lesions greater than 3cm in size. The angiographic appearance of a hemangioma is classic, with puddling of contrast material within the tumor, which remains visible on delayed, prolonged filming sequences.

This is a 47 year old white female without significant prior medical history, who presents with three weeks of nausea with new onset of jaundice.  There is intrahepatic biliary and pancreatic duct dilatation. An enhancing 3 x 3 x 4 cm pancreatic head mass is identified. The mass abuts the right lateral surface of the superior mesenteric vein, but there is apparent preservation of a separating fat plane. The superior mesenteric artery, portal vein, and IVC are patent and show no evidence of encasement. A single 12 mm lymph node is identified within the porta. No other retroperitoneal adenopathy is seen. In the lateral segment of the left hepatic lobe is a 7mm hypodense lesion which is suspicious for metastatic disease. An ill defined low density lesion may also be present in the posterior segment of the right hepatic lobe. The gastrohepatic ligament is free of adenopathy.  This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass;however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

Colorectal adenocarcinoma is one of the most common neoplasms encountered in the affluent countries of the Western world. The disease exhibits a peak age incidence in the sixth and seventh decades. It is associated with increased serum concentration of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Predisposing factors for colorectal cancer include adenomatous polyps, inherited multiple polyposis syndromes, long-standing ulcerative colitis, close relatives with colon cancer, and a low fiber, high animal fat diet. Colorectal cancer varies in gross presentation according to the region of the colon involved. Carcinoma of the rectosigmoid colon usually presents in an annular manner, often producing early bowel obstruction. Carcinoma of the right colon, however, usually does not obstruct early and frequently presents with iron deficiency anemia secondary to chronic blood loss. Colon cancer spreads by direct extension due to penetration of the colon wall, lymphatic drainage to regional nodes, through the portal system to the liver, and intraperitoneal seeding. Although barium enemas and colonoscopy are the primary methods used to initially diagnose colorectal cancer, CT is an excellent procedure for the detection of recurrence. CT findings of colon cancer include focal lobulated soft tissue mass in the colon, localized thickening of greater than 5 mm of the bowel wall, irregular lumen surface, extension of linear soft tissue densities or discrete mass into pericolic fat or adjacent organs, regional adenopathy, and liver metastases. Soft tissue masses visualized within the peritoneal cavity may signify metastases or recurrence of the cancer. Calcification in the primary tumor can be seen with mucinous adenocarcinoma. 85% of renal neoplasms are renal cell carcinomas, most commonly occurring in men, at ages 50-70, and usually involving one kidney. Only 2% are bilateral. Metastases are present at the time of diagnosis in 40% of cases. Since surgery is the only cure, early detection and accurate staging are important. The most common CT finding is a solid mass although low density areas due to hemorrhage or necrosis may be present. Cystic and multicystic forms may be seen. Stippled central or \"eggshell\" peripheral calcifications are seen in 10%. These tumors are usually hypervascular which may be evidenced by the presence of tortuous vessels in the perirenal fat. Tumor growth into the renal vein occurs in 30% of the time and into the inferior vena cava 5-10%. Venous invasion does not preclude surgical resection, but its identification is crucial to surgical planning. Renal cell carcinomas may spread locally to perirenal fat and adjacent organs. This is seen as strand or nodules of low density. Enlargement of renal hilar, pericaval, and periaortic nodes to 15mm or more indicates lymphatic spread. Hematogenous spread to the lung, bone, liver, adrenals, and the opposite kidney may occur. Distant metastases occasionally disappear with the removal of the primary tumor.

Multiple varices are seen involving the splenic hilum, gastrosplenic, gastrohepatic ligament, gastric wall, paraumbilical as well as gallbladder wall. A small amount of ascites is present. There is splenic enlargement without focal lesions.  Liver cirrhosis is characterized by a generalized disorganization of hepatic archictecture with scarring and nodule formation. Other sequelae include liver cell damage, regenerative activity, and generalized fibrosis resulting in a nodular pattern. There is an increased incidence of hepatocelluar carcinoma associated with cirrhosis of the liver. Causes of cirrhosis include prolonged alcohol intake, viral hepatitis, biliary obstruction, Wilsons disease, and heart failure with long-standing chronic passive congestion of the liver. Alcoholic (Laennecs, nutritional) cirrhosis is the most frequently occurring form of the disorder. Clinical manifestations of the disease include jaundice, hypoalbuminemia, coagulation factor deficiencies, hyperstrinism, and intrahepatic scarring with increased portal venous pressure. The increase in portal venous pressure can lead to esophageal varices, rectal hemorrhiods, periumbilical venous collaterals (caput medusae), and splenomegaly. Morphologically, the liver may be enlarged or small and shrunken depending upon the progression of the disease. The nodular pattern is most often micronodular in alcoholic cirrhosis. Hepatic architecture is obscured by fibrous bands surrounding nodules of distorted liver cell plates. The fibrous bands contain proliferating bile ducts and inflammatory cells. In the final stages of cirrhosis the nodules become larger and more irregular resulting in a scarred, shrunken liver referred to as a \"hobnail liver\". Patients with cirrhosis of the liver often present with the following radiological findings. Fatty infiltration with hepatomegaly can be seen in the early stages of cirrhosis. Other characteristic findings include non-uniform attenuation due to chronic fatty infiltration and irregular fibrosis, irregular lobulated hepatic contour due to areas of atrophy and nodular regeneration, intrahepatic regenerating nodules, atrophy of the right lobe and hypertrophy of the left and caudate lobes, decreased liver volume accompanying chronic cirrhosis, increased size and prominence of the intrahepatic fissure due to shrunken liver parenchyma, signs of portal hypertension, and ascites. A ratio comparing the sizes of the caudate lobe and right lobe is a good diagnostic indicator of patients with cirrhosis. The caudate is measured transversely from the medial aspect of the caudate to the lateral aspect of the main portal vein. The right lobe is measured from this same point at the portal vein to the right lateral margin of the liver. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio greater than 0.65 provides 96% confidence in the diagnosis of cirrhosis.

Benign ovarian cysts appear as well-defined, thin-walled homogeneous masses with internal density near that of water. They are avascular, and fluid-fluid levels are detectable. Internal contents move with changes in position. Functional cysts are the most common type of ovarian cysts and usually resolve after one to two menstrual cycles. In polycycstic ovary disease, cysts are usually bilateral. On CT, both ovaries are enlarged and contain multiple cysts. Sometimes cysts are too small to be detected on CT, but ovaries appear enlarged. Clinical findings in polycystic ovary disease include obesity, hirsutism, and amenorrhea.

Ill defined subtle strandy changes are noted in the adjacent perirectal fat which are suspicious for perirectal tumor spread. Multiple calcific granulomas are identified in the spleen which is otherwise normal in appearance and size. There is no intra-abdominal retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  Colorectal adenocarcinoma is one of the most common neoplasms encountered in the affluent countries of the Western world. The disease exhibits a peak age incidence in the sixth and seventh decades. It is associated with increased serum concentration of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Predisposing factors for colorectal cancer include adenomatous polyps, inherited multiple polyposis syndromes, long-standing ulcerative colitis, close relatives with colon cancer, and a low fiber, high animal fat diet. Colorectal cancer varies in gross presentation according to the region of the colon involved. Carcinoma of the rectosigmoid colon usually presents in an annular manner, often producing early bowel obstruction. Carcinoma of the right colon, however, usually does not obstruct early and frequently presents with iron deficiency anemia secondary to chronic blood loss. Colon cancer spreads by direct extension due to penetration of the colon wall, lymphatic drainage to regional nodes, through the portal system to the liver, and intraperitoneal seeding. Although barium enemas and colonoscopy are the primary methods used to initially diagnose colorectal cancer, CT is an excellent procedure for the detection of recurrence. CT findings of colon cancer include focal lobulated soft tissue mass in the colon, localized thickening of greater than 5 mm of the bowel wall, irregular lumen surface, extension of linear soft tissue densities or discrete mass into pericolic fat or adjacent organs, regional adenopathy, and liver metastases.

Recurrent epigastric pain and nausea for twelve months. Outside ultrasound showed multiple hepatic metastases and cholelithiasis.  Multiple low density lesions are scattered widely throughout both lobes of the liver. Many of the larger lesions have an enhancing rim. In the tail of the pancreas there is a hypodense mass which measures 2.5 x 3 cm. There is no lymphadenopathy.  This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass; however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs or the SMA, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

This is an 88-year-old female who presented with jaundice. A pancreatic head mass was seen on ultrasound. CT was done to further evaluate this mass.  A large 10 cm x 7 cm heterogenous mass demonstrating both cystic and solid components appears to be arising from the pancreatic head. There is marked dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct. The body and tail of the pancreas is atrophic. This pancreatic mass encases the SMA with irregularity and narrowing of the SMA consistent with invasion. The SMV and IMV are obliterated by the tumor mass. The portal vein is occluded as well. No definite hepatic metastases are identified, however, small areas of metastasis may be missed as there are breathing artifacts.  This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass; however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs or the SMA, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

Colorectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death in the United States. It appears to be associated with diets high in animal fat and protein and low in fiber. Seventy percent of colorectal cancers occur in the rectosigmoid region. Rectal cancers may present with bleeding, change in bowel habits, perineal pain, and symptoms of invasion of adjacent organs including hematuria, urinary frequency, or vaginal fistulas. Surgical removal is the only effective therapy. Anterior resection with anastomosis to the rectal stump is performed for upper rectal tumors and a combined abdominal and perineal resection with a permanent colostomy for distal rectal lesions. On CT, rectal lesions may appear as focal lobulated soft tissue masses with asymmetrical or circumferential thickening of the bowel wall. Narrowing of the lumen and bowel obstruction may be evident. Extension into pericolonic fat or adjacent structures, regional adenopathy, adrenal or liver metastases, and hydronephrosis may also be visualized. Common sites of local extension include the pelvic musculature, bladder, prostate, ovaries, and seminal vesicles.

A small amount of soft tissue density is seen within the mass, as well as some soft tissue stranding around the kidney. Most likely, this represents resolving hematoma. Since the previous study, there has been near total interval resolution of hematoma. There is moderate splenomegaly, with numerous splenic vein collaterals.  Renal angiomyelolipoma is a benign mesenchymal tumor composed of abnormal blood vessels which lack smooth muscle, elastic tissue, and fat in varying amounts. 80% of tumors are found in middle-aged women and are solitary and unilateral. The other 20% are found in patients with tuberous sclerosis. These are usually multiple and bilateral and commonly detected during childhood and infancy. These patients may also have multiple renal cysts and cutaneous, retinal, and cerebral hamartomas. Because of the fragile walls of the vessels, these tumors are prone to hemorrhage which can be massive. Solitary tumors are surgically removed. Demonstration of fat density within the tumor on CT is considered diagnostic since renal cell carcinomas do not contain fat detectable by CT. Typical findings include nodules and strands of soft tissue density representing smooth muscle and vascular components. In addition, vasculature may show remarkable contrast enhancement.

A colonoscopy performed 8/6/95, revealed a mass in the proximal descending colon, and an intraluminal stent was placed. The patient also complains of left hip pain.  A mesh-stent is noted in the descending colon with a thickened bowel wall surrounding it. A large mass is noted with necrotic/cystic areas, measuring 6.5 x 8.0 x 10.0 cm, extending from the lower pole of the left kidney. This mass appears to be impinging on the descending colon.

The pancreas is normal. The adrenals are normal. No lymphadenopathy is noted.  Colorectal adenocarcinoma is one of the most common neoplasms encountered in the affluent countries of the Western world. The disease exhibits a peak age incidence in the sixth and seventh decades. It is associated with increased serum concentration of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Predisposing factors for colorectal cancer include adenomatous polyps, inherited multiple polyposis syndromes, long-standing ulcerative colitis, close relatives with colon cancer, and a low fiber, high animal fat diet. Colorectal cancer varies in gross presentation according to the region of the colon involved. Carcinoma of the rectosigmoid colon usually presents in an annular manner, often producing early bowel obstruction. Carcinoma of the right colon, however, usually does not obstruct early and frequently presents with iron deficiency anemia secondary to chronic blood loss. Colon cancer spreads by direct extension due to penetration of the colon wall, lymphatic drainage to regional nodes, through the portal system to the liver, and intraperitoneal seeding. Although barium enemas and colonoscopy are the primary methods used to initially diagnose colorectal cancer, CT is an excellent procedure for the detection of recurrence. CT findings of colon cancer include focal lobulated soft tissue mass in the colon, localized thickening of greater than 5 mm of the bowel wall, irregular lumen surface, extension of linear soft tissue densities or discrete mass into pericolic fat or adjacent organs, regional adenopathy, and liver metastases. Soft tissue masses visualized within the peritoneal cavity may signify metastases or recurrence of the cancer. Calcification in the primary tumor can be seen with mucinous adenocarcinoma. 85% of renal neoplasms are renal cell carcinomas, most commonly occurring in men, at ages 50-70, and usually involving one kidney. Only 2% are bilateral. Metastases are present at the time of diagnosis in 40% of cases. Since surgery is the only cure, early detection and accurate staging are important. The most common CT finding is a solid mass although low density areas due to hemorrhage or necrosis may be present. Cystic and multicystic forms may be seen. Stippled central or \"eggshell\" peripheral calcifications are seen in 10%. These tumors are usually hypervascular which may be evidenced by the presence of tortuous vessels in the perirenal fat. Tumor growth into the renal vein occurs in 30% of the time and into the inferior vena cava 5-10%. Venous invasion does not preclude surgical resection, but its identification is crucial to surgical planning. Renal cell carcinomas may spread locally to perirenal fat and adjacent organs. This is seen as strand or nodules of low density. Enlargement of renal hilar, pericaval, and periaortic nodes to 15mm or more indicates lymphatic spread. Hematogenous spread to the lung, bone, liver, adrenals, and the opposite kidney may occur. Distant metastases occasionally disappear with the removal of the primary tumor.

The mass also encases and obstructs the left renal vein and superior mesenteric vein. Numerous varices are identified as a result of these venous obstructions. A moderate amount of biliary ductal dilatation is present. Pneumobilia secondary to recent ERCP is noted.  This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass; however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs or the SMA, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

The liver has cirrhotic morphology along with ill- defined heterogeneous infiltrating mass involving the right hepatic lobe and extending into the caudate lobe inferiorly. There are large areas of necrosis in it. The mass compressing approximately 5 cm of lower intrahepatic IVC. Direct IVC invasion cannot be certainly excluded. Multiple varices are seen involving the splenic hilum, gastrosplenic, gastrohepatic ligament, gastric wall, paraumbilical as well as gallbladder wall. A small amount of ascites is present. There is splenic enlargement without focal lesions.  Liver cirrhosis is characterized by a generalized disorganization of hepatic archictecture with scarring and nodule formation. Other sequelae include liver cell damage, regenerative activity, and generalized fibrosis resulting in a nodular pattern. There is an increased incidence of hepatocelluar carcinoma associated with cirrhosis of the liver. Causes of cirrhosis include prolonged alcohol intake, viral hepatitis, biliary obstruction, Wilsons disease, and heart failure with long-standing chronic passive congestion of the liver. Alcoholic (Laennecs, nutritional) cirrhosis is the most frequently occurring form of the disorder. Clinical manifestations of the disease include jaundice, hypoalbuminemia, coagulation factor deficiencies, hyperstrinism, and intrahepatic scarring with increased portal venous pressure. The increase in portal venous pressure can lead to esophageal varices, rectal hemorrhiods, periumbilical venous collaterals (caput medusae), and splenomegaly. Morphologically, the liver may be enlarged or small and shrunken depending upon the progression of the disease. The nodular pattern is most often micronodular in alcoholic cirrhosis. Hepatic architecture is obscured by fibrous bands surrounding nodules of distorted liver cell plates. The fibrous bands contain proliferating bile ducts and inflammatory cells. In the final stages of cirrhosis the nodules become larger and more irregular resulting in a scarred, shrunken liver referred to as a \"hobnail liver\". Patients with cirrhosis of the liver often present with the following radiological findings. Fatty infiltration with hepatomegaly can be seen in the early stages of cirrhosis. Other characteristic findings include non-uniform attenuation due to chronic fatty infiltration and irregular fibrosis, irregular lobulated hepatic contour due to areas of atrophy and nodular regeneration, intrahepatic regenerating nodules, atrophy of the right lobe and hypertrophy of the left and caudate lobes, decreased liver volume accompanying chronic cirrhosis, increased size and prominence of the intrahepatic fissure due to shrunken liver parenchyma, signs of portal hypertension, and ascites. A ratio comparing the sizes of the caudate lobe and right lobe is a good diagnostic indicator of patients with cirrhosis. The caudate is measured transversely from the medial aspect of the caudate to the lateral aspect of the main portal vein. The right lobe is measured from this same point at the portal vein to the right lateral margin of the liver. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio greater than 0.65 provides 96% confidence in the diagnosis of cirrhosis. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio less then 0.6 makes cirrhosis unlikely, whereas a ratio of 0.37 is the average for normal livers.", "image_path": ["00133504.jpg"], "split": "train"}, {"id": "00137444.jpg", "report": "RADIOLOGY: ABDOMEN:  RETROPERITONEAL SARCOMA", "image_path": ["00137444.jpg"], "split": "train"}, {"id": "00135125.jpg", "report": "RADIOLOGY: GASTROINTESTINAL: GI:  MANTLE CELL LYMPHOMA.  73 year old male.

There is a large hypodense mass involving the tail of the pancreas which extends into the posterior wall of the stomach. The splenic vein is thrombosed and the splenic artery is very irregular as it passes through the mass. The superior mesenteric and celiac arteries are involved by the mass.  This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass;however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs or the SMA, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

At the site of the neoplasm, the colon abuts the left psoas muscle and the border between psoas and colon is not well defined.  Colorectal adenocarcinoma is one of the most common neoplasms encountered in the affluent countries of the Western world. The disease exhibits a peak age incidence in the sixth and seventh decades. It is associated with increased serum concentration of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Predisposing factors for colorectal cancer include adenomatous polyps, inherited multiple polyposis syndromes, long-standing ulcerative colitis, close relatives with colon cancer, and a low fiber, high animal fat diet. Colorectal cancer varies in gross presentation according to the region of the colon involved. Carcinoma of the rectosigmoid colon usually presents in an annular manner, often producing early bowel obstruction. Carcinoma of the right colon, however, usually does not obstruct early and frequently presents with iron deficiency anemia secondary to chronic blood loss. Colon cancer spreads by direct extension due to penetration of the colon wall, lymphatic drainage to regional nodes, through the portal system to the liver, and intraperitoneal seeding. Although barium enemas and colonoscopy are the primary methods used to initially diagnose colorectal cancer, CT is an excellent procedure for the detection of recurrence. CT findings of colon cancer include focal lobulated soft tissue mass in the colon, localized thickening of greater than 5 mm of the bowel wall, irregular lumen surface, extension of linear soft tissue densities or discrete mass into pericolic fat or adjacent organs, regional adenopathy, and liver metastases.

Multiple calcific granulomas are identified in the spleen which is otherwise normal in appearance and size. There is no intra-abdominal retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  Colorectal adenocarcinoma is one of the most common neoplasms encountered in the affluent countries of the Western world. The disease exhibits a peak age incidence in the sixth and seventh decades. It is associated with increased serum concentration of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Predisposing factors for colorectal cancer include adenomatous polyps, inherited multiple polyposis syndromes, long-standing ulcerative colitis, close relatives with colon cancer, and a low fiber, high animal fat diet. Colorectal cancer varies in gross presentation according to the region of the colon involved. Carcinoma of the rectosigmoid colon usually presents in an annular manner, often producing early bowel obstruction. Carcinoma of the right colon, however, usually does not obstruct early and frequently presents with iron deficiency anemia secondary to chronic blood loss. Colon cancer spreads by direct extension due to penetration of the colon wall, lymphatic drainage to regional nodes, through the portal system to the liver, and intraperitoneal seeding. Although barium enemas and colonoscopy are the primary methods used to initially diagnose colorectal cancer, CT is an excellent procedure for the detection of recurrence. CT findings of colon cancer include focal lobulated soft tissue mass in the colon, localized thickening of greater than 5 mm of the bowel wall, irregular lumen surface, extension of linear soft tissue densities or discrete mass into pericolic fat or adjacent organs, regional adenopathy, and liver metastases.

The adjacent sigmoid colon demonstrates significant wall thickening. The remainder of the colon appears unremarkable. Exam 2: Within the abdomen, ascites has developed, when compared with the previous study, and can be seen extending around the liver and spleen and into the lesser sac. Retrocrural and para-aortic lymphadenopathy is unchanged from the previous examination. Within the pelvis, the markedly thickened wall and haustral folds of the sigmoid colon are again demonstrated.

Free fluid is seen within the pelvis adjacent to the bladder and sigmoid colon.  Lymphomas are malignant neoplasms which can be classified as either Hodgkins disease or non-Hodgkins lymphoma based on the presence of the Reed-Sternberg giant cell which is the key morphological finding in Hodgkins disease. Non- Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL) usually presents as a localized or generalized adenopathy, although in one third of cases the disease may be primary in other sites where lymphoid tissue is located such as the oropharyngeal region, gut, bone marrow, and skin. All lymphomas have the potential to metastasize to other lymph nodes and eventually to infiltrate the spleen, bone marrow, and liver. If the disease spreads to the blood the patients peripheral blood will resemble that of a leukemic patient. CT findings of NHL include multiple enlarged individual nodes and coalescence of enlarged nodes to form rounded multilobular masses which may encase vessels, displace organs, and obstruct ureters. Conglomerate nodal masses are typical of lymphoma and are rarely seen in other diseases. CT findings of primary and secondary lymphoma of the liver include low attenuation masses which are often large and well circumscribed.

Colorectal adenocarcinoma is one of the most common neoplasms encountered in the affluent countries of the Western world. The disease exhibits a peak age incidence in the sixth and seventh decades. It is associated with increased serum concentration of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Predisposing factors for colorectal cancer include adenomatous polyps, inherited multiple polyposis syndromes, long-standing ulcerative colitis, close relatives with colon cancer, and a low fiber, high animal fat diet. Colorectal cancer varies in gross presentation according to the region of the colon involved. Carcinoma of the rectosigmoid colon usually presents in an annular manner, often producing early bowel obstruction. Carcinoma of the right colon, however, usually does not obstruct early and frequently presents with iron deficiency anemia secondary to chronic blood loss. Colon cancer spreads by direct extension due to penetration of the colon wall, lymphatic drainage to regional nodes, through the portal system to the liver, and intraperitoneal seeding. Although barium enemas and colonoscopy are the primary methods used to initially diagnose colorectal cancer, CT is an excellent procedure for the detection of recurrence. CT findings of colon cancer include focal lobulated soft tissue mass in the colon, localized thickening of greater than 5 mm of the bowel wall, irregular lumen surface, extension of linear soft tissue densities or discrete mass into pericolic fat or adjacent organs, regional adenopathy, and liver metastases. Soft tissue masses visualized within the peritoneal cavity may signify metastases or recurrence of the cancer.

This mass compresses the common bile duct and is associated with a large amount of intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, as well as dilatation of the pancreatic duct within the tail. This pancreatic mass also compresses the portal vein, splenic vein, inferior vena cava, and the superior mesenteric vein; however, each of these veins is patent. The pancreatic mass also abuts and possibly invades the posterior gastric antral wall. Multiple enlarged peripancreatic, periaortic, porta hepatic, portocaval, and gastric ligament lymph nodes are identified. A focal area of low attenuation is seen within the medial aspect of the left hepatic lobe which most likely represents focal fatty infiltration; however, metastasis cannot be entirely excluded.  This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass;however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs or the SMA, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

A recent cardiac catheterization revealed an ejection fraction (EF) of 20% and severe diffuse coronary stenosis of the proximal LAD. 18-FDG-PET was requested to evaluate for ischemic myocardium that could be salvaged with coronary bypass and subsequently improve the EF. An alternative treatment option was cardiac transplantation. A transmission CT of the chest was first obtained using revolving Ge-68 (a positron emitter) pins as transmission sources. This transmission data was used to correct for non-uniform attenuation encountered within the chest. The patient was then injected with 15 mCi of 15-NH3 IV and imaging begun 3 minutes afterward. The images depict resting perfusion in the left ventricle. The patient was given a glucose load and blood sugars were monitored according to a protocol involving insulin and glucose loading to ensure a blood sugar between 130-160 mg % prior to and after tracer injection. 10 mCi of [18-F] FDG was then injected IV and 30 minutes later PET imaging was performed. The images depict glucose metabolism within the myocardium.  Images above are long axis images from the Glucose metabolism study. Images above are long axis images from the perfusion study. Images above are short axis images from the Glucose metabolism study. Images above are short axis images from the perfusion study. Diminished perfusion is noted in the anterior, anteroseptal, and anteroapical walls. However, the glucose metabolism in these areas is relatively greater than the perfusion suggesting viability in the anterior, anteroapical and to a lesser degree in the anteroseptal region.  Myocardial viability is a vital factor in estimating the prognostic success of coronary bypass. Normally the myocardium utilizes short-chain fatty acids for metabolism. Ischemic myocardium shifts to glucose metabolism.

There are multiple linear areas of low attenuation in the spleen consistent with splenic laceration and contusion. There is free fluid around the spleen as well. Fluid is noted in both pericolic gutters and the cul-de-sac consistent with hemorrhage.

Pancreatic trauma is uncommon and associated with a high mortality since it is often occult. It is usually the result of blunt trauma, particularly child abuse. Trauma to the pancreas may cause pancreatitis, lacerations, and transections. Complete transection may be diagnosed by CT which will generally show two ends of the pancreas separated by low-density fluid that remains relatively confined to the anterior pararenal space in the immediate post-injury period. Pancreatic enlargement may also be evident. A feature common to most hepatic injury is intrahepatic hemorrhage. Hemorrhage often has a layered appearance caused by successive bleeding and clotting. Hemoperitoneum may occur in injuries extending through the capsule with bleeding or bile leakage. Other causes of intraperitoneal fluid, urine and ascites, are possible. High density fluid, however, suggests recent bleeding. Lacerations or fractures may be stellate or linear. They are defined on CT by hematoma within the area of injury.

Normal anatomical positioning is termed situs solitus. The cardiac apex, aortic arch, and stomach are all normally on the left. In addition, the anatomic left atrium is on the same side as the hyparterial bronchus and bilobed lung; the anatomic right atrium is on the same side as the eparterial bronchus and trilobed lung.

As shown above, situs inversus is a mirror image of normal anatomy. In situs inversus totalis, the cardiac apex, stomach and aortic arch are all on the right.

Situs inversus with levocardia (right-sided stomach and left-sided heart) is associated with congenital heart disease in 95% of cases, but is very rare. Kartageners syndrome may also be seen in connection with situs inversus. Kartageners syndrome represents a triad of situs inversus (seen in 50% of cases), sinusitis, and bronchiectasis.

Patient is a 17 y.o. young man with a history of complex partial seizures.  Selected axial and coronal images from an interictal18-FDG PET study reveal hypometabolism of the left anterior temporal lobe. MRI T2 weighted image through the temporal lobes reveals an area of increased signal intensity in the left hippocampus.  18-FDG is a glucose analoge that competes with glucose for uptake. Once it is actively transported, it is then phosphorylated but not further metabolized. Consequently its accumulation within a cell is a function of the cells metabolic rate. Preoperative planning for epilepsy surgery often includes an interictal PET study to localize the epilepsy site. Focal hypometabolism relative to the contralateral structures suggests a seizure focus. PET will demonstrate interictal temporal lobe hypometabolism in 70% of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (1). Proper interpretation requires knowledge of any seizure activity that may have occurred during the uptake of the 18-FDG, in which case a hypermetabolic focus may be seen. Another approach to localization of seizure foci has been ictal Tc-99m HMPAO (or ECD) brain SPECT. This also has a sensitivity of 70% of depicting epileptic foci but requires rapid administration of a radiopharmaceutical immediately upon seizure activity (1). An interictal SPECT study is usually obtained as a baseline study for comparison with the ictal scan. Also, the interictal SPECT study has a 55% incidence of showing hypoperfusion at the epilepsy site (2). Patient Prep: The patients EEG was monitored shortly before, during uptake, and during imaging. Since ingested glucose could compete with the 18-2 flouro-2 deoxyglucose(18-FDG), the patient should be NPO 4 hours prior to injection. The patient was injected with 10 mCi of 18-flouro-2deoxy-glucose IV and was taken to a quiet, dark room. The patient was instructed not to sleep and to keep his eyes open.

A 53 year-old Black female who complained of a sensation of something \"dropping\" in her pelvis several months prior to imaging as well as dysuria that resolved with oral antibiotics several weeks ago. Cystoscopy done just prior to radiologic evaluation was unremarkable.  Two large radiopaque stones projecting over the lower pubic symphysis on scout film. VCUG demonstrated a posterior urethral diverticulum which contained both sontes within it. Bladder was normal. The diverticulum opening was located near the bladder neck.  The female urethra, which is homologous to the posterior urethra in the male minus the verumontanum, is approximately 4 cm long. It courses obliquely downward from the internal urethral opening and is slightly curved, although its course is normally quite variable. The urethra contains periuurethral glands (throughout its length?), and glands similar to the male prostatic glands are often also present. Most female diverticula are acquired rather than congenital and occur posteriorly in the midurethra. They are thought to result from infected periurethral glands that form abscess cavities that then rupture into the urethral lumen. Other possible causes of acquired diverticula include trauma during childbirth, instrumenation and fulguration of urethral lesions, urethral strictures or stones. Both benign and malignant tumors arising within the diverticulum itself have also been described in case reports. Acquired diverticula are thought to be present in up to 3% of asymptomatic females. Complications can include stone formation, dysuria, frequent urinary tract infections and dyspareunia, as well as post-void dribbling. Physical exam is usually normal although a palpable, bulging mass is occasionally present and this was the case with the patient presented here in whom one of her diverticular stones had actually begun to erode through the diverticular wall which was clearly visible at her introitus. Other than location, the differentiation between congenital versus acqured diverticula can be very difficult. Congenital diverticula usually occur in the anterior urethra and are almost exclusively a male phenomenon. The appearance of urethral diverticula can be quite variable dependingon the location and the patients sex as well. They can be multiple, or multilocular, saccular, tubular or ovoid and can have a variable number of openings into the urethral lumen. In females, the diverticulum is usually short-necked and tubular or oval. Cystoscopy is not very sensitive, missing up to 60% of cases.

This is a 47 year old white female without significant prior medical history, who presents with three weeks of nausea with new onset of jaundice.  There is intrahepatic biliary and pancreatic duct dilatation. An enhancing 3 x 3 x 4 cm pancreatic head mass is identified. The mass abuts the right lateral surface of the superior mesenteric vein, but there is apparent preservation of a separating fat plane. The superior mesenteric artery, portal vein, and IVC are patent and show no evidence of encasement. A single 12 mm lymph node is identified within the porta. No other retroperitoneal adenopathy is seen. In the lateral segment of the left hepatic lobe is a 7mm hypodense lesion which is suspicious for metastatic disease. An ill defined low density lesion may also be present in the posterior segment of the right hepatic lobe. The gastrohepatic ligament is free of adenopathy.  This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass;however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

Metastases are present at the time of diagnosis in 40% of cases. Since surgery is the only cure, early detection and accurate staging are important. The most common CT finding is a solid mass although low density areas due to hemorrhage or necrosis may be present. Cystic and multicystic forms may be seen. Stippled central or \"eggshell\" peripheral calcifications are seen in 10%. These tumors are usually hypervascular which may be evidenced by the presence of tortuous vessels in the perirenal fat. Tumor growth into the renal vein occurs in 30% of the time and into the inferior vena cava 5-10%. Venous invasion does not preclude surgical resection, but its identification is crucial to surgical planning. Renal cell carcinomas may spread locally to perirenal fat and adjacent organs. This is seen as strand or nodules of low density. Enlargement of renal hilar, pericaval, and periaortic nodes to 15mm or more indicates lymphatic spread.

Complications of abdominal aortic aneurysm include rupture, peripheral embolization, thrombosis, and infection. The incidence of rupture increases with increasing aneurysm size above 4 cm. Rupture usually occurs into the left retroperitoneal space and rarely into the gastrointestinal tract and inferior vena cava. If a ruptured or leaking aneurysm is suspected, CT should be done with contrast enhancement. Typical findings include obscuration or anterior displacement of the aneurysm by an irregular high density mass or collection that extends into one or both perirenal spaces.

Multiple fluid filled cyst-like structures are seen throughout the pancreas, the largest of which measures 5.0 x 6.0 cm.  Fatty infiltration of the liver is one of the most common abnormalities diagnosed on CT of the liver. Fatty change is the response of the liver to various insults such as alcoholism, diabetes, obesity, steroid therapy, and malnutrition. In general, fatty change lowers the attenuation of the liver parenchyma causing hepatic vessels to stand out. While the attenuation of normal liver is equal to or greater than that of normal spleen, liver that has undergone fatty change appears more lucent than normal spleen. Fatty infiltration may involve the liver diffusely, focally, or multifocally. The diffuse pattern is the most common. CT shows decreased attenuation of the entire liver with the vessels standing out prominently following administration of contrast. The liver is usually enlarged. In focal involvement, a fan-shaped area may show fatty change and low attenuation while the rest of the liver appears normal, while in multifocal involvement, there are multiple patchy areas of fatty change which may appear similar to metastases or hepatoma. Fatty infiltration may be differentiated from tumor by the absence of mass effect or vessel displacement, the angulated geometric margins, interdigitating margins with slender fingers of normal or fatty tissue, and the rapid change over time.

A large amount of intraluminal thrombus is present throughout the lower thoracic and infrarenal AAA.  Abdominal aortic aneurysms usually occur in the setting of atherosclerotic disease but may be caused by syphilis, by extension of a dissection from above, or by connective tissue disorders such as Takayasus arteritis. Complications of abdominal aortic aneurysm include rupture, peripheral embolization, thrombosis, and infection. The incidence of rupture increases with increasing aneurysm size above 4 cm. Rupture usually occurs into the left retroperitoneal space and rarely into the gastrointestinal tract and inferior vena cava. If a ruptured or leaking aneurysm is suspected, CT should be done with contrast enhancement. Typical findings include obscuration or anterior displacement of the aneurysm by an irregular high density mass or collection that extends into one or both perirenal spaces.

This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass;however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs or the SMA, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

Pancreatic trauma is uncommon and associated with a high mortality since it is often occult. It is usually the result of blunt trauma, particularly child abuse. Trauma to the pancreas may cause pancreatitis, lacerations, and transections. Complete transection may be diagnosed by CT which will generally show two ends of the pancreas separated by low-density fluid that remains relatively confined to the anterior pararenal space in the immediate post-injury period. Pancreatic enlargement may also be evident. A feature common to most hepatic injury is intrahepatic hemorrhage. Hemorrhage often has a layered appearance caused by successive bleeding and clotting. Hemoperitoneum may occur in injuries extending through the capsule with bleeding or bile leakage. Other causes of intraperitoneal fluid, urine and ascites, are possible. High density fluid, however, suggests recent bleeding. Lacerations or fractures may be stellate or linear. They are defined on CT by hematoma within the area of injury.

Hepatic uptake of the radiopharmaceutical (5 mCi of Tc-99m DISOFENIN) was rapid, suggesting adequate liver function. Excretion into the duodenum excluded a complete common duct obstruction. No filling of the gallbladder was noted by 60 minutes. Intravenous morphine sulfate (.04 mg/kg) was administered and an image 30 minutes later failed to demonstrate filling of the gallbladder.  Hepatobiliary scans are useful in determining the patency of the cystic duct. An occluded cystic duct is the hallmark of acute cholecystitis. Failure of the technetium-99m n-iminodiacetic acid to fill the gallbladder implies an occluded duct. Chronic cholecystitis can also demonstrate an initial absence of filling; however, delayed images at 4 hours usually demonstrate gallbladder filling. Recently, a morphine augmented study design has been introduced to shorten the overall study time. If no gallbladder is visualized after one hour and no common duct obstruction is noted, morphine is given to constrict the sphincter of Oddi, increasing the intraductal pressure. Non filling of the gallbladder 30 minutes after morphine injection confirms acute cholecystitis.

The aortic arch and descending throacic aorta are on the right. The stomach is right-sided and the liver is left-sided. There is a single spleen on the right.  Normal anatomical positioning is termed situs solitus. The cardiac apex, aortic arch, and stomach are all normally on the left. In addition, the anatomic left atrium is on the same side as the hyparterial bronchus and bilobed lung; the anatomic right atrium is on the same side as the eparterial bronchus and trilobed lung. With normal situs and levocardia, the incidence of congenital heart disease is less than 1%; with dextrocardia, the incidence rises to 95%. As shown above, situs inversus is a mirror image of normal anatomy. In situs inversus totalis, the cardiac apex, stomach and aortic arch are all on the right. Situs inversus totalis is associated with a 5-10% incidence of congenital heart disease. Situs inversus with levocardia (right-sided stomach and left-sided heart) is associated with congenital heart disease in 95% of cases, but is very rare. Kartageners syndrome may also be seen in connection with situs inversus. Kartageners syndrome represents a triad of situs inversus (seen in 50% of cases), sinusitis, and bronchiectasis. The latter two parts of the triad are due to immotile or dysmotile cilia affecting the respiratory epithelium, auditory epithelium, and the sperm in males; therefore, hearing difficulties and infertility may also be found in this syndrome. Two other situs abnormalities are worth noting. Situs ambiguous with bilateral \"right-sidedness\" is known as Asplenia syndrome. In this syndrome, the spleen is absent, both lungs have three lobes, and the left and right lobes of the liver are similar. The cardiac apex may be in either hemithorax.

The celiac axis itself appears encases by the mass and nodal metastases. The origin of the SMA is also encased by nodal metastases. A cystic lesion within the tail of the pancreas most likely represents a pseudocyst secondary to pancreatic duct obstruction by the mass. The mass abuts the posterior gastric wall with possible invasion. By CT, this mass appears unresectable (due to the amount of vascular encasement).  This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass;however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs or the SMA, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

Overall, the mass measures approximately 11cm AP by 7cm transverse by 12cm cranio-caudal. There is a thin rim of preserved renal parenchyma inferiorly, with hydronephrosis of the adjacent collecting system.

There are large areas of necrosis in it. The mass compressing approximately 5 cm of lower intrahepatic IVC. Direct IVC invasion cannot be certainly excluded. Multiple varices are seen involving the splenic hilum, gastrosplenic, gastrohepatic ligament, gastric wall, paraumbilical as well as gallbladder wall. A small amount of ascites is present. There is splenic enlargement without focal lesions.  Liver cirrhosis is characterized by a generalized disorganization of hepatic archictecture with scarring and nodule formation. Other sequelae include liver cell damage, regenerative activity, and generalized fibrosis resulting in a nodular pattern. There is an increased incidence of hepatocelluar carcinoma associated with cirrhosis of the liver. Causes of cirrhosis include prolonged alcohol intake, viral hepatitis, biliary obstruction, Wilsons disease, and heart failure with long-standing chronic passive congestion of the liver. Alcoholic (Laennecs, nutritional) cirrhosis is the most frequently occurring form of the disorder. Clinical manifestations of the disease include jaundice, hypoalbuminemia, coagulation factor deficiencies, hyperstrinism, and intrahepatic scarring with increased portal venous pressure. The increase in portal venous pressure can lead to esophageal varices, rectal hemorrhiods, periumbilical venous collaterals (caput medusae), and splenomegaly. Morphologically, the liver may be enlarged or small and shrunken depending upon the progression of the disease. The nodular pattern is most often micronodular in alcoholic cirrhosis. Hepatic architecture is obscured by fibrous bands surrounding nodules of distorted liver cell plates. The fibrous bands contain proliferating bile ducts and inflammatory cells. In the final stages of cirrhosis the nodules become larger and more irregular resulting in a scarred, shrunken liver referred to as a \"hobnail liver\". Patients with cirrhosis of the liver often present with the following radiological findings. Fatty infiltration with hepatomegaly can be seen in the early stages of cirrhosis. Other characteristic findings include non-uniform attenuation due to chronic fatty infiltration and irregular fibrosis, irregular lobulated hepatic contour due to areas of atrophy and nodular regeneration, intrahepatic regenerating nodules, atrophy of the right lobe and hypertrophy of the left and caudate lobes, decreased liver volume accompanying chronic cirrhosis, increased size and prominence of the intrahepatic fissure due to shrunken liver parenchyma, signs of portal hypertension, and ascites. A ratio comparing the sizes of the caudate lobe and right lobe is a good diagnostic indicator of patients with cirrhosis. The caudate is measured transversely from the medial aspect of the caudate to the lateral aspect of the main portal vein. The right lobe is measured from this same point at the portal vein to the right lateral margin of the liver. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio greater than 0.65 provides 96% confidence in the diagnosis of cirrhosis.

A 66 year old female with chest pain.  The ascending aorta and aortic arch appear normal. There is aortic dissection in the descending thoracic aorta beginning immediately distal to the arch and extending into the proximal abdominal aorta. The true lumen is compressed and false lumen is significantly thrombosed.  CT has to a large degree replaced arteriography in diagnosing aortic dissection and determining its type and location. The diagnosis is made by the demonstration of an intimal flap, displaced inward from the edge of the aorta and lying between the true and false channels. In Dailys classification, types A and B are described with type A being more common. Type A involves the ascending aorta and is usually treated surgically because of the potential for retrograde dissection. Type B involves the area distal to the left subclavian artery and is treated medically. CT is used for screening those with suspected aortic dissection and for follow-up of patients previously diagnosed with dissection. It should be performed with bolus contrast enhancement and dynamic scanning at three levels: (1) the aortic arch; (2) the proximal aortic root and descending aorta near the level of the pulmonary artery; (3) the more distal descending thoracic aorta. Newer helical CT scanners allow rapid scanning of the arch during bolus contrast injection eliminating the need for the \"three level scan\". Two passes can be made throught the aortic arch early in the contrast injection. In a patient with dissection, the intimal flap may be delineated by contrast filling both the true and false channels. One of the channels may fill slowly, thus requiring the use of images late in the sequence to make the diagnosis. A false channel that contains a clot may not opacify and in such a case, may be difficult to distinguish from a clot-filled atherosclerotic aneurysm. Dissections, however, are usually longer than clot-filled aneurysms and may produce an abrupt change in aortic caliber and thickening of the aortic wall. Streak artifacts due to wall motion or vascular pulsations may mimic an intimal flap. Streak artifacts are usually seen in the descending aorta adjacent to the left heart. They are usually less well-defined than a true intimal flap, extending beyond the edge of the aorta and inconsistently seen from level to level.

Additionally, PET can direct biopsies toward more metabolically active tumor sites thus reducing sampling error and improving pathological diagnosis. Serial studies can also detect transformation of low grade astrocytomas to higher grades. Careful registration of PET with anatomical studies such as CT/ MRI is vital to proper interpretation because; 1) variations in metabolism seen commonly within tumors can complicate edge definition between normal and abnormal tissue on PET images; and 2) metabolic activity of a tumor is graded relative to the surrounding normal tissue which is better depicted with MRI/CT.

All lymphomas have the potential to metastasize to other lymph nodes and eventually to infiltrate the spleen, bone marrow, and liver. If the disease spreads to the blood the patients peripheral blood will resemble that of a leukemic patient. CT findings of NHL include multiple enlarged individual nodes and coalescence of enlarged nodes to form rounded multilobular masses which may encase vessels, displace organs, and obstruct ureters. Conglomerate nodal masses are typical of lymphoma and are rarely seen in other diseases.

There is a large amount of ascites. The liver has a cirrhotic configuration, however, no focal lesions are identified on this examination. Cholelithiasis is present.

The visualized portions of the lung bases demonstrate increased opacity over the posterior aspect of the right lower lobe consistent with atelectasis versus pneumonia. Incidental note is made of a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt catheter.  Liver cirrhosis is characterized by a generalized disorganization of hepatic archictecture with scarring and nodule formation. Other sequelae include liver cell damage, regenerative activity, and generalized fibrosis resulting in a nodular pattern. There is an increased incidence of hepatocelluar carcinoma associated with cirrhosis of the liver. Causes of cirrhosis include prolonged alcohol intake, viral hepatitis, biliary obstruction, Wilsons disease, and heart failure with long-standing chronic passive congestion of the liver. Alcoholic (Laennecs, nutritional) cirrhosis is the most frequently occurring form of the disorder. Clinical manifestations of the disease include jaundice, hypoalbuminemia, coagulation factor deficiencies, hyperstrinism, and intrahepatic scarring with increased portal venous pressure. The increase in portal venous pressure can lead to esophageal varices, rectal hemorrhiods, periumbilical venous collaterals (caput medusae), and splenomegaly. Morphologically, the liver may be enlarged or small and shrunken depending upon the progression of the disease. The nodular pattern is most often micronodular in alcoholic cirrhosis. Hepatic architecture is obscured by fibrous bands surrounding nodules of distorted liver cell plates. The fibrous bands contain proliferating bile ducts and inflammatory cells. In the final stages of cirrhosis the nodules become larger and more irregular resulting in a scarred, shrunken liver referred to as a \"hobnail liver\". Patients with cirrhosis of the liver often present with the following radiological findings. Fatty infiltration with hepatomegaly can be seen in the early stages of cirrhosis. Other characteristic findings include non-uniform attenuation due to chronic fatty infiltration and irregular fibrosis, irregular lobulated hepatic contour due to areas of atrophy and nodular regeneration, intrahepatic regenerating nodules, atrophy of the right lobe and hypertrophy of the left and caudate lobes, decreased liver volume accompanying chronic cirrhosis, increased size and prominence of the intrahepatic fissure due to shrunken liver parenchyma, signs of portal hypertension, and ascites. A ratio comparing the sizes of the caudate lobe and right lobe is a good diagnostic indicator of patients with cirrhosis. The caudate is measured transversely from the medial aspect of the caudate to the lateral aspect of the main portal vein. The right lobe is measured from this same point at the portal vein to the right lateral margin of the liver. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio greater than 0.65 provides 96% confidence in the diagnosis of cirrhosis. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio less then 0.6 makes cirrhosis unlikely, whereas a ratio of 0.37 is the average for normal livers.", "image_path": ["00133401.jpg"], "split": "train"}, {"id": "00134853.jpg", "report": "RADIOLOGY: HEPATOBILIARY:  HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA.

The patient is a 47 year old woman with a recent `Q wave myocardial infarction suggesting a transmural defect. The infarct area involved the anterior wall of the left ventricle. A recent cardiac catheterization revealed an ejection fraction (EF) of 20% and severe diffuse coronary stenosis of the proximal LAD. 18-FDG-PET was requested to evaluate for ischemic myocardium that could be salvaged with coronary bypass and subsequently improve the EF. An alternative treatment option was cardiac transplantation. A transmission CT of the chest was first obtained using revolving Ge-68 (a positron emitter) pins as transmission sources. This transmission data was used to correct for non-uniform attenuation encountered within the chest. The patient was then injected with 15 mCi of 15-NH3 IV and imaging begun 3 minutes afterward. The images depict resting perfusion in the left ventricle. The patient was given a glucose load and blood sugars were monitored according to a protocol involving insulin and glucose loading to ensure a blood sugar between 130-160 mg % prior to and after tracer injection. 10 mCi of [18-F] FDG was then injected IV and 30 minutes later PET imaging was performed. The images depict glucose metabolism within the myocardium.  Images above are long axis images from the Glucose metabolism study. Images above are long axis images from the perfusion study. Images above are short axis images from the Glucose metabolism study. Images above are short axis images from the perfusion study. Diminished perfusion is noted in the anterior, anteroseptal, and anteroapical walls. However, the glucose metabolism in these areas is relatively greater than the perfusion suggesting viability in the anterior, anteroapical and to a lesser degree in the anteroseptal region.  Myocardial viability is a vital factor in estimating the prognostic success of coronary bypass. Normally the myocardium utilizes short-chain fatty acids for metabolism. Ischemic myocardium shifts to glucose metabolism. A relative increase in FDG activity relative to the perfusion in the underperfused areas indicates ischemic (or hibernating) and possibly salvageable myocardium with bypass surgery.", "image_path": ["00134082.jpg"], "split": "train"}, {"id": "00137508.jpg", "report": "RADIOLOGY: HEPATOBILIARY:  COMMON BILE DUCT STONES.

There is a large heterogeneous mass within the body and tail of the pancreas. Numerous small low attenuation lesions are present within the liver.  This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass; however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs or the SMA, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

Multiple varices are seen involving the splenic hilum, gastrosplenic, gastrohepatic ligament, gastric wall, paraumbilical as well as gallbladder wall. A small amount of ascites is present. There is splenic enlargement without focal lesions.  Liver cirrhosis is characterized by a generalized disorganization of hepatic archictecture with scarring and nodule formation. Other sequelae include liver cell damage, regenerative activity, and generalized fibrosis resulting in a nodular pattern. There is an increased incidence of hepatocelluar carcinoma associated with cirrhosis of the liver. Causes of cirrhosis include prolonged alcohol intake, viral hepatitis, biliary obstruction, Wilsons disease, and heart failure with long-standing chronic passive congestion of the liver. Alcoholic (Laennecs, nutritional) cirrhosis is the most frequently occurring form of the disorder. Clinical manifestations of the disease include jaundice, hypoalbuminemia, coagulation factor deficiencies, hyperstrinism, and intrahepatic scarring with increased portal venous pressure. The increase in portal venous pressure can lead to esophageal varices, rectal hemorrhiods, periumbilical venous collaterals (caput medusae), and splenomegaly. Morphologically, the liver may be enlarged or small and shrunken depending upon the progression of the disease. The nodular pattern is most often micronodular in alcoholic cirrhosis. Hepatic architecture is obscured by fibrous bands surrounding nodules of distorted liver cell plates. The fibrous bands contain proliferating bile ducts and inflammatory cells. In the final stages of cirrhosis the nodules become larger and more irregular resulting in a scarred, shrunken liver referred to as a \"hobnail liver\". Patients with cirrhosis of the liver often present with the following radiological findings. Fatty infiltration with hepatomegaly can be seen in the early stages of cirrhosis. Other characteristic findings include non-uniform attenuation due to chronic fatty infiltration and irregular fibrosis, irregular lobulated hepatic contour due to areas of atrophy and nodular regeneration, intrahepatic regenerating nodules, atrophy of the right lobe and hypertrophy of the left and caudate lobes, decreased liver volume accompanying chronic cirrhosis, increased size and prominence of the intrahepatic fissure due to shrunken liver parenchyma, signs of portal hypertension, and ascites. A ratio comparing the sizes of the caudate lobe and right lobe is a good diagnostic indicator of patients with cirrhosis. The caudate is measured transversely from the medial aspect of the caudate to the lateral aspect of the main portal vein. The right lobe is measured from this same point at the portal vein to the right lateral margin of the liver. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio greater than 0.65 provides 96% confidence in the diagnosis of cirrhosis.

Alcoholic (Laennecs, nutritional) cirrhosis is the most frequently occurring form of the disorder. Clinical manifestations of the disease include jaundice, hypoalbuminemia, coagulation factor deficiencies, hyperstrinism, and intrahepatic scarring with increased portal venous pressure. The increase in portal venous pressure can lead to esophageal varices, rectal hemorrhiods, periumbilical venous collaterals (caput medusae), and splenomegaly. Morphologically, the liver may be enlarged or small and shrunken depending upon the progression of the disease. The nodular pattern is most often micronodular in alcoholic cirrhosis. Hepatic architecture is obscured by fibrous bands surrounding nodules of distorted liver cell plates. The fibrous bands contain proliferating bile ducts and inflammatory cells. In the final stages of cirrhosis the nodules become larger and more irregular resulting in a scarred, shrunken liver referred to as a \"hobnail liver\". Patients with cirrhosis of the liver often present with the following radiological findings. Fatty infiltration with hepatomegaly can be seen in the early stages of cirrhosis. Other characteristic findings include non-uniform attenuation due to chronic fatty infiltration and irregular fibrosis, irregular lobulated hepatic contour due to areas of atrophy and nodular regeneration, intrahepatic regenerating nodules, atrophy of the right lobe and hypertrophy of the left and caudate lobes, decreased liver volume accompanying chronic cirrhosis, increased size and prominence of the intrahepatic fissure due to shrunken liver parenchyma, signs of portal hypertension, and ascites. A ratio comparing the sizes of the caudate lobe and right lobe is a good diagnostic indicator of patients with cirrhosis. The caudate is measured transversely from the medial aspect of the caudate to the lateral aspect of the main portal vein. The right lobe is measured from this same point at the portal vein to the right lateral margin of the liver. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio greater than 0.65 provides 96% confidence in the diagnosis of cirrhosis. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio less then 0.6 makes cirrhosis unlikely, whereas a ratio of 0.37 is the average for normal livers.", "image_path": ["00133400.jpg"], "split": "train"}, {"id": "00134638.jpg", "report": "RADIOLOGY: PANCREAS:  PANCREAS CARCINOMA NICE ARTERIAL PHASE.  81-year-old female with renal cell carcinoma, status post right nephrectomy in 1997.  1.

The spleen is normal in appearance without focal lesions evident. The common hepatic duct is visualized and is not dilated. Multiple fluid filled cyst-like structures are seen throughout the pancreas, the largest of which measures 5.0 x 6.0 cm.  Fatty infiltration of the liver is one of the most common abnormalities diagnosed on CT of the liver. Fatty change is the response of the liver to various insults such as alcoholism, diabetes, obesity, steroid therapy, and malnutrition. In general, fatty change lowers the attenuation of the liver parenchyma causing hepatic vessels to stand out. While the attenuation of normal liver is equal to or greater than that of normal spleen, liver that has undergone fatty change appears more lucent than normal spleen. Fatty infiltration may involve the liver diffusely, focally, or multifocally. The diffuse pattern is the most common. CT shows decreased attenuation of the entire liver with the vessels standing out prominently following administration of contrast. The liver is usually enlarged. In focal involvement, a fan-shaped area may show fatty change and low attenuation while the rest of the liver appears normal, while in multifocal involvement, there are multiple patchy areas of fatty change which may appear similar to metastases or hepatoma. Fatty infiltration may be differentiated from tumor by the absence of mass effect or vessel displacement, the angulated geometric margins, interdigitating margins with slender fingers of normal or fatty tissue, and the rapid change over time.

Low attenuation tumor in the head of the pancreas is noted surrounding the celiac axis and SMA with mild narrowing. Multiple peripancreatic lymph nodes are noted; the largest measuring 3 x 2 cm. Surgical clips are noted in the gallbladder fossa, consistent with prior cholecystectomy.  This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass;however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs or the SMA, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

The spleen, kidneys, adrenals, pancreas, and small and large bowel are otherwise radiographically unremarkable.  Colorectal adenocarcinoma is one of the most common neoplasms encountered in the affluent countries of the Western world. The disease exhibits a peak age incidence in the sixth and seventh decades. It is associated with increased serum concentration of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Predisposing factors for colorectal cancer include adenomatous polyps, inherited multiple polyposis syndromes, long-standing ulcerative colitis, close relatives with colon cancer, and a low fiber, high animal fat diet. Colorectal cancer varies in gross presentation according to the region of the colon involved. Carcinoma of the rectosigmoid colon usually presents in an annular manner, often producing early bowel obstruction. Carcinoma of the right colon, however, usually does not obstruct early and frequently presents with iron deficiency anemia secondary to chronic blood loss. Colon cancer spreads by direct extension due to penetration of the colon wall, lymphatic drainage to regional nodes, through the portal system to the liver, and intraperitoneal seeding. Although barium enemas and colonoscopy are the primary methods used to initially diagnose colorectal cancer, CT is an excellent procedure for the detection of recurrence. CT findings of colon cancer include focal lobulated soft tissue mass in the colon, localized thickening of greater than 5 mm of the bowel wall, irregular lumen surface, extension of linear soft tissue densities or discrete mass into pericolic fat or adjacent organs, regional adenopathy, and liver metastases. Soft tissue masses visualized within the peritoneal cavity may signify metastases or recurrence of the cancer.

This is a 62 year old male who is three years status post right radical nephrectomy for a renal cell carcinoma. The patient had a previous abdominal CT done two months ago that showed a suspicious liver mass.  Pre-contrast images through the liver demonstrate a 2 x 1.5cm low attenuation mass inferiorly and posteriorly which was identified on the previous CT and a 4 x 4cm low attenuation mass within the posterior segment of the right lobe not previously identified. The 4cm mass shows intense but fairly homogenous peripheral enhancement with central low attenuation. Delayed images through the liver show central filling of the large mass. The smaller mass is not visible on post contrast images. The appearance of the small lesion is grossly unchanged from the prior study when it was thought to be a hemangioma.  The liver is a common site for the metastatic spread of malignant tumors. Metatstatic lesions are the most common malignant tumor of the liver. Most arise from the colon, although they may originate from almost any primary malignancy. Liver metastases are usually multiple, well-defined, low density solid masses. When there is fatty infiltration, the masses may appear as high density solid masses. When the tumor is mucinous colon or ovarian carcinoma, melanoma, lung, or carcinoid, the tumor may have a cystic or necrotic appearance. Metastatic lesions may also be calcified. A solitary metastatic lesion may present a problem in differentiation. Thus it is necessary to consider the other possibilities such as hepatoma, hepatic adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, and cavernous hemangioma. Cavernous hemangiomas are the second most common focal mass found in the liver. They are usually asyptomatic, however when very large, may cause symptoms by pressure effect, hemorrhage, or arteriovenous shunting. The classic CT findings include a well-defined hypodense mass of same density of other blood-filled spaces, the development of nodule-like areas of enhancement from the periphery following administration of a bolus of contrast, areas of enhancement become confluent and isodense of hyperdense relative to the liver parenchyma, prolonged retention of contrast material, persisting within the lesion for 20 to 30 minutes, and discrete areas of fibrosis and calcification which remain hypodense throughtout the enhancement period.", "image_path": ["00133335.jpg"], "split": "train"}, {"id": "00134454.jpg", "report": "RADIOLOGY: ABDOMEN:  MAC WITH LOW DENSITY NODES.

CMV colitis can produce colonic wall thickening. CMV colitis may also show a \"target sign\" due to submucosal edema. CMV infection often extends across the ileocecal valve to involve the ileum. Severe CMV colitis may result in distention and even perforation. Findings in ischemic colitis may be similar. \"Thumbprinting\" may be seen in the colonic wall mucosa representing heaped-up, inflamed areas of mucosa.

There is aortic dissection of the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta starting near the origin of left subclavian artery and extending down to the level of aortobifem bypass graft. No intimal flap is noted in the ascending aorta. There is minimal irregularity of the thoracic aortic wall near the left subclavian region along with para-aortic hematoma which has CT attenuation value of 45-50 HU. The celiac, SMA, and right renal artery appear to arise from the true lumen whereas the left renal artery appears to arise from the false lumen.  CT has to a large degree replaced arteriography in diagnosing aortic dissection and determining its type and location. The diagnosis is made by the demonstration of an intimal flap, displaced inward from the edge of the aorta and lying between the true and false channels. In Dailys classification, types A and B are described with type A being more common. Type A involves the ascending aorta and is usually treated surgically because of the potential for retrograde dissection. Type B involves the area distal to the left subclavian artery and is treated medically. CT is used for screening those with suspected aortic dissection and for follow-up of patients previously diagnosed with dissection. It should be performed with bolus contrast enhancement and dynamic scanning at three levels: (1) the aortic arch; (2) the proximal aortic root and descending aorta near the level of the pulmonary artery; (3) the more distal descending thoracic aorta. Newer helical CT scanners allow rapid scanning of the arch during bolus contrast injection eliminating the need for the \"three level scan\". Two passes can be made throught the aortic arch early in the contrast injection. In a patient with dissection, the intimal flap may be delineated by contrast filling both the true and false channels. One of the channels may fill slowly, thus requiring the use of images late in the sequence to make the diagnosis. A false channel that contains a clot may not opacify and in such a case, may be difficult to distinguish from a clot-filled atherosclerotic aneurysm. Dissections, however, are usually longer than clot-filled aneurysms and may produce an abrupt change in aortic caliber and thickening of the aortic wall. Streak artifacts due to wall motion or vascular pulsations may mimic an intimal flap. Streak artifacts are usually seen in the descending aorta adjacent to the left heart. They are usually less well-defined than a true intimal flap, extending beyond the edge of the aorta and inconsistently seen from level to level.

There is aortic dissection of the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta starting near the origin of left subclavian artery and extending down to the level of aortobifem bypass graft. No intimal flap is noted in the ascending aorta. There is minimal irregularity of the thoracic aortic wall near the left subclavian region along with para-aortic hematoma which has CT attenuation value of 45-50 HU. The celiac, SMA, and right renal artery appear to arise from the true lumen whereas the left renal artery appears to arise from the false lumen.  CT has to a large degree replaced arteriography in diagnosing aortic dissection and determining its type and location. The diagnosis is made by the demonstration of an intimal flap, displaced inward from the edge of the aorta and lying between the true and false channels. In Dailys classification, types A and B are described with type A being more common. Type A involves the ascending aorta and is usually treated surgically because of the potential for retrograde dissection. Type B involves the area distal to the left subclavian artery and is treated medically. CT is used for screening those with suspected aortic dissection and for follow-up of patients previously diagnosed with dissection. It should be performed with bolus contrast enhancement and dynamic scanning at three levels: (1) the aortic arch; (2) the proximal aortic root and descending aorta near the level of the pulmonary artery; (3) the more distal descending thoracic aorta. Newer helical CT scanners allow rapid scanning of the arch during bolus contrast injection eliminating the need for the \"three level scan\". Two passes can be made throught the aortic arch early in the contrast injection. In a patient with dissection, the intimal flap may be delineated by contrast filling both the true and false channels. One of the channels may fill slowly, thus requiring the use of images late in the sequence to make the diagnosis. A false channel that contains a clot may not opacify and in such a case, may be difficult to distinguish from a clot-filled atherosclerotic aneurysm. Dissections, however, are usually longer than clot-filled aneurysms and may produce an abrupt change in aortic caliber and thickening of the aortic wall. Streak artifacts due to wall motion or vascular pulsations may mimic an intimal flap. Streak artifacts are usually seen in the descending aorta adjacent to the left heart. They are usually less well-defined than a true intimal flap, extending beyond the edge of the aorta and inconsistently seen from level to level.

There is complete situs inversus. The liver is only mildly cirrhotic in configuration with slight prominence of the caudate and left hepatic lobes. No focal hepatic lesions are seen. The spleen is moderately enlarged. There is extensive diverticulosis of the colon.  Normal anatomical positioning is termed situs solitus. The cardiac apex, aortic arch, and stomach are all normally on the left. In addition, the anatomic left atrium is on the same side as the hyparterial bronchus and bilobed lung; the anatomic right atrium is on the same side as the eparterial bronchus and trilobed lung. With normal situs and levocardia, the incidence of congenital heart disease is less than 1%; with dextrocardia, the incidence rises to 95%. As shown above, situs inversus is a mirror image of normal anatomy. In situs inversus totalis, the cardiac apex, stomach and aortic arch are all on the right. Situs inversus totalis is associated with a 5-10% incidence of congenital heart disease. Situs inversus with levocardia (right-sided stomach and left-sided heart) is associated with congenital heart disease in 95% of cases, but is very rare. Kartageners syndrome may also be seen in connection with situs inversus. Kartageners syndrome represents a triad of situs inversus (seen in 50% of cases), sinusitis, and bronchiectasis. The latter two parts of the triad are due to immotile or dysmotile cilia affecting the respiratory epithelium, auditory epithelium, and the sperm in males; therefore, hearing difficulties and infertility may also be found in this syndrome. Two other situs abnormalities are worth noting. Situs ambiguous with bilateral \"right-sidedness\" is known as Asplenia syndrome. In this syndrome, the spleen is absent, both lungs have three lobes, and the left and right lobes of the liver are similar. The cardiac apex may be in either hemithorax. Complex cardiac anomalies are usually found in this syndrome. Situs ambiguous with bilateral \"left-sidedness\" is called Polysplenia syndrome. The lungs each have two lobes, multiple small spleens are present, and the cardiac apex may be in either hemithorax. The cardiac anomalies associated with polysplenia syndrome are less complex giving this syndrome a better prognosis than asplenia syndrome.", "image_path": ["00100116.jpg"], "split": "train"}, {"id": "00135182.jpg", "report": "RADIOLOGY: HEPATOBILIARY:  LIVER METASTASIS.

Although common bile duct stones may form de novo in the biliary tree, most come from the gallbladder. CT is about 95% accurate in diagnosing biliary obstruction. CT diagnosis is based on the findings of dilated intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts. This dilatation may be absent in cirrhosis, cholangitis, or periductal fibrosis, thereby creating a false-negative. Dilated intrahepatic ducts will appear as branching tubular or round structures of low density enlarging as they approach the porta hepatis. Dilatation of the common bile duct to greater than 7mm in diameter also indicates obstruction. CT is also useful in differentiating causes of obstruction. Abrupt tapering of a dilated duct suggests a malignant process, such as pancreatic carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma, whereas gradual tapering is more commonly seen with an inflammatory process such as chronic pancreatitis. Gallstones are visualized as calcified or soft tissue density structures within the bile duct surrounded by lower density bile creating a target sign.

This is an 88-year-old female who presented with jaundice. A pancreatic head mass was seen on ultrasound. CT was done to further evaluate this mass.  A large 10 cm x 7 cm heterogenous mass demonstrating both cystic and solid components appears to be arising from the pancreatic head. There is marked dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct. The body and tail of the pancreas is atrophic. This pancreatic mass encases the SMA with irregularity and narrowing of the SMA consistent with invasion. The SMV and IMV are obliterated by the tumor mass. The portal vein is occluded as well. No definite hepatic metastases are identified, however, small areas of metastasis may be missed as there are breathing artifacts.  This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass; however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs or the SMA, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

The mass also encases and obstructs the left renal vein and superior mesenteric vein. Numerous varices are identified as a result of these venous obstructions. A moderate amount of biliary ductal dilatation is present. Pneumobilia secondary to recent ERCP is noted.  This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass; however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs or the SMA, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

The ascending aorta and aortic arch appear normal. There is aortic dissection in the descending thoracic aorta beginning immediately distal to the arch and extending into the proximal abdominal aorta. The true lumen is compressed and false lumen is significantly thrombosed.  CT has to a large degree replaced arteriography in diagnosing aortic dissection and determining its type and location. The diagnosis is made by the demonstration of an intimal flap, displaced inward from the edge of the aorta and lying between the true and false channels. In Dailys classification, types A and B are described with type A being more common. Type A involves the ascending aorta and is usually treated surgically because of the potential for retrograde dissection. Type B involves the area distal to the left subclavian artery and is treated medically. CT is used for screening those with suspected aortic dissection and for follow-up of patients previously diagnosed with dissection. It should be performed with bolus contrast enhancement and dynamic scanning at three levels: (1) the aortic arch; (2) the proximal aortic root and descending aorta near the level of the pulmonary artery; (3) the more distal descending thoracic aorta. Newer helical CT scanners allow rapid scanning of the arch during bolus contrast injection eliminating the need for the \"three level scan\". Two passes can be made throught the aortic arch early in the contrast injection. In a patient with dissection, the intimal flap may be delineated by contrast filling both the true and false channels. One of the channels may fill slowly, thus requiring the use of images late in the sequence to make the diagnosis. A false channel that contains a clot may not opacify and in such a case, may be difficult to distinguish from a clot-filled atherosclerotic aneurysm. Dissections, however, are usually longer than clot-filled aneurysms and may produce an abrupt change in aortic caliber and thickening of the aortic wall. Streak artifacts due to wall motion or vascular pulsations may mimic an intimal flap. Streak artifacts are usually seen in the descending aorta adjacent to the left heart.

Hepatocellular carcinoma usually appears as a hypodense or isodense lesion on nonenhanced images and enhances prominently during the arterial phase on dynamic contrast injection. Areas of tumor necrosis and calcification are common. Tumor invasion of hepatic and portal veins occurs frequently causing thrombosis of these vessels. Portal vein thrombosis may be accompanied by portal hypertension and its manifestations such as formation of collaterals, splenomegaly, and ascites. Portal vein thrombosis is readily diagnosed by CT and is best visualized with the incremental dynamic imaging technique. Acutely, the involved vessel enlarges, and the vessel wall may appear thickened and enhanced. There may be a small amount of contrast passing around the thrombus. The vessel itself has a relatively low central density. Serial examinations may show a change in the location or extent of thrombus, recanalization of the vessel, or retraction of the thrombus with collateral vein enlargement. Evidence of cavernous transformation of the portal vein may be seen as marked dilation of the periportal collaterals.

CT is done is to rule out abscess or possible perforated viscus. No prior abdominal CTs for comparison.  The liver has a markedly diffuse, heterogeneous parenchymal density with large regions in the anterior and posterior aspects of the right liver lobe which are diffusely hypodense persistently even on delayed images. This appearance raises the possibility of hepatic necrosis. In the enhancing regions, there is a diffuse punctate heterogeneity which is suggestive of hepatic cirrhosis. There are multiple, small gallstones in the region of the gallbladder neck. Common duct appears non-dilated. There is diffuse circumferential gastrointestinal wall thickening from the visualized portions of the lower esophagus inferiorly to the rectum. This is most prominent in the stomach and duodenal regions. There is a small amount of ascites, noted most around the anterior aspect of the right liver lobe and in the pelvis. A moderate degree of fluid is present in the anterior pararenal space predominantly in a peripancreatic distribution and extending into the bilateral anterior pararenal fascial locations and more prominently in the right ascending colonic region. There is diffuse increased mesenteric streaky changes consistent with congestion. An umbilical varix is identified.  Liver cirrhosis is characterized by a generalized disorganization of hepatic archictecture with scarring and nodule formation. Other sequelae include liver cell damage, regenerative activity, and generalized fibrosis resulting in a nodular pattern. There is an increased incidence of hepatocelluar carcinoma associated with cirrhosis of the liver. Causes of cirrhosis include prolonged alcohol intake, viral hepatitis, biliary obstruction, Wilsons disease, and heart failure with long-standing chronic passive congestion of the liver. Alcoholic (Laennecs, nutritional) cirrhosis is the most frequently occurring form of the disorder. Clinical manifestations of the disease include jaundice, hypoalbuminemia, coagulation factor deficiencies, hyperstrinism, and intrahepatic scarring with increased portal venous pressure. The increase in portal venous pressure can lead to esophageal varices, rectal hemorrhiods, periumbilical venous collaterals (caput medusae), and splenomegaly. Morphologically, the liver may be enlarged or small and shrunken depending upon the progression of the disease. The nodular pattern is most often micronodular in alcoholic cirrhosis. Hepatic architecture is obscured by fibrous bands surrounding nodules of distorted liver cell plates. The fibrous bands contain proliferating bile ducts and inflammatory cells. In the final stages of cirrhosis the nodules become larger and more irregular resulting in a scarred, shrunken liver referred to as a \"hobnail liver\". Patients with cirrhosis of the liver often present with the following radiological findings. Fatty infiltration with hepatomegaly can be seen in the early stages of cirrhosis. Other characteristic findings include non-uniform attenuation due to chronic fatty infiltration and irregular fibrosis, irregular lobulated hepatic contour due to areas of atrophy and nodular regeneration, intrahepatic regenerating nodules, atrophy of the right lobe and hypertrophy of the left and caudate lobes, decreased liver volume accompanying chronic cirrhosis, increased size and prominence of the intrahepatic fissure due to shrunken liver parenchyma, signs of portal hypertension, and ascites. A ratio comparing the sizes of the caudate lobe and right lobe is a good diagnostic indicator of patients with cirrhosis. The caudate is measured transversely from the medial aspect of the caudate to the lateral aspect of the main portal vein. The right lobe is measured from this same point at the portal vein to the right lateral margin of the liver. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio greater than 0.65 provides 96% confidence in the diagnosis of cirrhosis. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio less then 0.6 makes cirrhosis unlikely, whereas a ratio of 0.37 is the average for normal livers.", "image_path": ["00133441.jpg"], "split": "train"}, {"id": "00133619.jpg", "report": "RADIOLOGY: ADRENAL:  ADRENAL TB.  50 year old male with fever and cough.

A large 10 cm x 7 cm heterogenous mass demonstrating both cystic and solid components appears to be arising from the pancreatic head. There is marked dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct. The body and tail of the pancreas is atrophic. This pancreatic mass encases the SMA with irregularity and narrowing of the SMA consistent with invasion. The SMV and IMV are obliterated by the tumor mass. The portal vein is occluded as well.

This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States.

The primary finding on CT is a focal mass; however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass.

Strandy opacities are present throughout the mesentery consistent with congestion and/or inflammation. A small amount of ascites is seen within the pelvis. Incidental note is made of a left simple renal cyst and gunshot fragments within the left paraspinal tissues.  Pancreatitis is thought to result from inappropriate intrapancreatic activation of proteases, causing autodigestion of the gland and leading to pancreatic inflammatory disease. The two most common causes of acute pancreatitis are ethanol abuse and choledocholithiasis. Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is made on the basis of the history, physical findings, and an elevation in the serum amylase. Since, however, serum amylase may be normal in 1/3 of patients having alcoholic pancreatitis, CT may be needed to confirm the diagnosis. CT findings include diffuse or focal glandular enlargement, contour irregularity, focal irregular areas of decreased attenuation secondary to necrosis or edema, and changes in the peripancreatic areolar tissues, fat, and parietal peritoneal planes. Hemorrhagic pancreatitis is an important manifestation of acute pancreatitis that may lead to hypovolemic shock and death. This may appear on CT as pancreatic and peripancreatic fluid collections with areas of high density, indicative of blood clots within the bed of the pancreas. These fluid collections may mimic pseudocysts, however, fluid collections due to hemorrhagic pancreatitis differ in that they change in size, shape, and location while pseudocysts tend to be more permanent. Typical CT findings of pseudocysts show low-density fluid masses with well-defined walls of variable thickness. Calcifications may occur within the pseudocysts. Intramural pseudocysts in the stomach, duodenum, and colon are relatively rare but do occur. These most commonly involve the posterolateral wall of the second part of the duodenum and may produce obstruction of the the bowel lumen. Features distinctive of intramural pseudocysts include extension along the wall of the duodenum, resulting in a tubular shape following the course of the duodenum, and abrupt flattening of the pseudocyst at the border of the duodenal lumen. Circumferential involvement of the duodenum may also occur.", "image_path": ["00133012.jpg"], "split": "train"}, {"id": "00135408.jpg", "report": "RADIOLOGY: GASTROINTESTINAL: GI:  INTERNAL HERNIA WITH SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION.  59 year old male with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary origin who has a known met in the L3 vertebral body.  1.

There is no evidence of intestinal obstruction or free air evident.  Colorectal adenocarcinoma is one of the most common neoplasms encountered in the affluent countries of the Western world. The disease exhibits a peak age incidence in the sixth and seventh decades. It is associated with increased serum concentration of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Predisposing factors for colorectal cancer include adenomatous polyps, inherited multiple polyposis syndromes, long-standing ulcerative colitis, close relatives with colon cancer, and a low fiber, high animal fat diet. Colorectal cancer varies in gross presentation according to the region of the colon involved. Carcinoma of the rectosigmoid colon usually presents in an annular manner, often producing early bowel obstruction. Carcinoma of the right colon, however, usually does not obstruct early and frequently presents with iron deficiency anemia secondary to chronic blood loss. Colon cancer spreads by direct extension due to penetration of the colon wall, lymphatic drainage to regional nodes, through the portal system to the liver, and intraperitoneal seeding. Although barium enemas and colonoscopy are the primary methods used to initially diagnose colorectal cancer, CT is an excellent procedure for the detection of recurrence. CT findings of colon cancer include focal lobulated soft tissue mass in the colon, localized thickening of greater than 5 mm of the bowel wall, irregular lumen surface, extension of linear soft tissue densities or discrete mass into pericolic fat or adjacent organs, regional adenopathy, and liver metastases.

This patient is a 51 year old male with a history of pancreatitis and pancreatic pseudocyst.  Comparison is made with the patients prior CT four months ago. The liver is diffusely low in attenuation consistent with fatty infiltration. There is an area of scar in the right lobe of the liver. This area was seen on the prior studies as an area of low attenuation in the right lobe. It is better defined today because of the fatty infiltration. No intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation is seen. There is no ascites seen on todays study. Multiple varices are present in the gastrohepatic ligament and splenic hilum.  Liver cirrhosis is characterized by a generalized disorganization of hepatic archictecture with scarring and nodule formation. Other sequelae include liver cell damage, regenerative activity, and generalized fibrosis resulting in a nodular pattern. There is an increased incidence of hepatocelluar carcinoma associated with cirrhosis of the liver. Causes of cirrhosis include prolonged alcohol intake, viral hepatitis, biliary obstruction, Wilsons disease, and heart failure with long-standing chronic passive congestion of the liver. Alcoholic (Laennecs, nutritional) cirrhosis is the most frequently occurring form of the disorder. Clinical manifestations of the disease include jaundice, hypoalbuminemia, coagulation factor deficiencies, hyperstrinism, and intrahepatic scarring with increased portal venous pressure. The increase in portal venous pressure can lead to esophageal varices, rectal hemorrhiods, periumbilical venous collaterals (caput medusae), and splenomegaly. Morphologically, the liver may be enlarged or small and shrunken depending upon the progression of the disease. The nodular pattern is most often micronodular in alcoholic cirrhosis. Hepatic architecture is obscured by fibrous bands surrounding nodules of distorted liver cell plates. The fibrous bands contain proliferating bile ducts and inflammatory cells. In the final stages of cirrhosis the nodules become larger and more irregular resulting in a scarred, shrunken liver referred to as a \"hobnail liver\". Patients with cirrhosis of the liver often present with the following radiological findings. Fatty infiltration with hepatomegaly can be seen in the early stages of cirrhosis. Other characteristic findings include non-uniform attenuation due to chronic fatty infiltration and irregular fibrosis, irregular lobulated hepatic contour due to areas of atrophy and nodular regeneration, intrahepatic regenerating nodules, atrophy of the right lobe and hypertrophy of the left and caudate lobes, decreased liver volume accompanying chronic cirrhosis, increased size and prominence of the intrahepatic fissure due to shrunken liver parenchyma, signs of portal hypertension, and ascites. A ratio comparing the sizes of the caudate lobe and right lobe is a good diagnostic indicator of patients with cirrhosis. The caudate is measured transversely from the medial aspect of the caudate to the lateral aspect of the main portal vein. The right lobe is measured from this same point at the portal vein to the right lateral margin of the liver. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio greater than 0.65 provides 96% confidence in the diagnosis of cirrhosis. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio less then 0.6 makes cirrhosis unlikely, whereas a ratio of 0.37 is the average for normal livers.", "image_path": ["00133447.jpg"], "split": "train"}, {"id": "00134785.jpg", "report": "RADIOLOGY: HEPATOBILIARY: 49-year-old white female with bone marrow transplant for lymphoma 12/96.  1.

A well-circumscribed rounded fluid collection is also noted in the region of the porta hepatis consistent with dilatation of the cystic duct remnant. No focal hepatic lesions are identified. Low attenuation tumor in the head of the pancreas is noted surrounding the celiac axis and SMA with mild narrowing. Multiple peripancreatic lymph nodes are noted; the largest measuring 3 x 2 cm. Surgical clips are noted in the gallbladder fossa, consistent with prior cholecystectomy.  This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass;however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs or the SMA, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

At the ureterovesicle junction, there is a 4 mm high attenuation object within the distal ureter and it is consistent with a ureteral calculus.

Radio-opaque stones such as calcium and some cystine stones may be visualized on plain abdominal films;however, visualizing radiolucent stones requires CT imaging. Radiolucent stones, such as uric acid, xanthine and cystine stones, have a higher attenuation than urine, renal parenchyma and blood clots on CT and thus can be differentiated from other causes of filling defects such a tumor or hematoma. The diagnosis of obstruction and hydronephrosis may be made with or without the use of contrast. It may be easier, however, to distinguish parenchyma from dilated calices with contrast. Extra-renal pelves, dilated calices secondary to post-obtructive atrophy, and parapelvic cysts may mimic changes due to hydronephrosis. On non-contrast-enhanced images, the dilated urine filled calices appear as low attenuation fluid filled structures within the normal or enlarged renal silhouette.

The gallbladder is markedly enlarged compared to a previous exam without cholelithiasis or gallbladder wall thickening. There is mild intrahepatic duct dilatation but marked dilatation of the common bile duct to a diameter of 2.0 cm. The pancreatic duct is only slightly dilated. A focal mass is present within the pancreatic head measuring 3.3 cm x 3.8 cm. The mass is notably larger than the pancreatic body and has enlarged since previous scan. There is no associated adenopathy. Past Exam:There is mild diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver. No other focal hepatic or splenic lesions are seen. The pancreas, adrenals, kidneys, ureters and bladder are unremarkable. No free intraperitoneal fluid or adenopathy is seen.  This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass;however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs or the SMA, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

Carcinoma of the right colon, however, usually does not obstruct early and frequently presents with iron deficiency anemia secondary to chronic blood loss. Colon cancer spreads by direct extension due to penetration of the colon wall, lymphatic drainage to regional nodes, through the portal system to the liver, and intraperitoneal seeding. Although barium enemas and colonoscopy are the primary methods used to initially diagnose colorectal cancer, CT is an excellent procedure for the detection of recurrence. CT findings of colon cancer include focal lobulated soft tissue mass in the colon, localized thickening of greater than 5 mm of the bowel wall, irregular lumen surface, extension of linear soft tissue densities or discrete mass into pericolic fat or adjacent organs, regional adenopathy, and liver metastases. Soft tissue masses visualized within the peritoneal cavity may signify metastases or recurrence of the cancer.

An alternative treatment option was cardiac transplantation. A transmission CT of the chest was first obtained using revolving Ge-68 (a positron emitter) pins as transmission sources. This transmission data was used to correct for non-uniform attenuation encountered within the chest. The patient was then injected with 15 mCi of 15-NH3 IV and imaging begun 3 minutes afterward. The images depict resting perfusion in the left ventricle. The patient was given a glucose load and blood sugars were monitored according to a protocol involving insulin and glucose loading to ensure a blood sugar between 130-160 mg % prior to and after tracer injection. 10 mCi of [18-F] FDG was then injected IV and 30 minutes later PET imaging was performed. The images depict glucose metabolism within the myocardium.  Images above are long axis images from the Glucose metabolism study. Images above are long axis images from the perfusion study. Images above are short axis images from the Glucose metabolism study. Images above are short axis images from the perfusion study. Diminished perfusion is noted in the anterior, anteroseptal, and anteroapical walls. However, the glucose metabolism in these areas is relatively greater than the perfusion suggesting viability in the anterior, anteroapical and to a lesser degree in the anteroseptal region.  Myocardial viability is a vital factor in estimating the prognostic success of coronary bypass. Normally the myocardium utilizes short-chain fatty acids for metabolism.

A 66 year old female with chest pain.  The ascending aorta and aortic arch appear normal. There is aortic dissection in the descending thoracic aorta beginning immediately distal to the arch and extending into the proximal abdominal aorta. The true lumen is compressed and false lumen is significantly thrombosed.  CT has to a large degree replaced arteriography in diagnosing aortic dissection and determining its type and location. The diagnosis is made by the demonstration of an intimal flap, displaced inward from the edge of the aorta and lying between the true and false channels. In Dailys classification, types A and B are described with type A being more common. Type A involves the ascending aorta and is usually treated surgically because of the potential for retrograde dissection. Type B involves the area distal to the left subclavian artery and is treated medically. CT is used for screening those with suspected aortic dissection and for follow-up of patients previously diagnosed with dissection. It should be performed with bolus contrast enhancement and dynamic scanning at three levels: (1) the aortic arch; (2) the proximal aortic root and descending aorta near the level of the pulmonary artery; (3) the more distal descending thoracic aorta. Newer helical CT scanners allow rapid scanning of the arch during bolus contrast injection eliminating the need for the \"three level scan\". Two passes can be made throught the aortic arch early in the contrast injection. In a patient with dissection, the intimal flap may be delineated by contrast filling both the true and false channels. One of the channels may fill slowly, thus requiring the use of images late in the sequence to make the diagnosis. A false channel that contains a clot may not opacify and in such a case, may be difficult to distinguish from a clot-filled atherosclerotic aneurysm. Dissections, however, are usually longer than clot-filled aneurysms and may produce an abrupt change in aortic caliber and thickening of the aortic wall. Streak artifacts due to wall motion or vascular pulsations may mimic an intimal flap. Streak artifacts are usually seen in the descending aorta adjacent to the left heart.

Overall, it measures 3.2cm transverse x 3.2cm AP.  CT is useful in staging cervical cancer, documenting response to therapy, and detecting recurrence. Most cervical cancers spread by direct extension to adjacent organs and appear as thick tissue strands or masses extending from the cervix to the parametrium, ureters, vagina, or pelvic side walls. . Lymphatic spread to the regional nodes is common. Enlargement of nodes may be evident, however, cervical cancer may involve the nodes without enlarging them. Metastasis to lung, bone, and brain is uncommon and occurs late. CT findings of the primary tumor include enlargement of the cervix, a hypodense mass within the cervix, and fluid in the endometrial cavity secondary to obstruction. Recurrences most commonly occur in the top of the vaginal vault in patients who have had hysterectomy, but may occur anywhere. Enlarged nodes in patients may indicate recurrence in a patient with a previous history of cervical cancer.", "image_path": ["00133720.jpg"], "split": "train"}, {"id": "00132997.jpg", "report": "RADIOLOGY: GASTROINTESTINAL: GI:  PERFORATED COLON CA WITH ABSCESS.

The splenic vein is thrombosed and the splenic artery is very irregular as it passes through the mass. The superior mesenteric and celiac arteries are involved by the mass.  This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass;however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs or the SMA, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

The spleen is moderately enlarged. There is extensive diverticulosis of the colon.  Normal anatomical positioning is termed situs solitus. The cardiac apex, aortic arch, and stomach are all normally on the left. In addition, the anatomic left atrium is on the same side as the hyparterial bronchus and bilobed lung; the anatomic right atrium is on the same side as the eparterial bronchus and trilobed lung.

As shown above, situs inversus is a mirror image of normal anatomy. In situs inversus totalis, the cardiac apex, stomach and aortic arch are all on the right.

The patient is a 55 year old black female with a pancreatic head mass seen on ultrasound.  A 3.0 x 4.0 cm heterogeneously enhancing mass is seen at the region of the pancreatic neck. This mass compresses the common bile duct and is associated with a large amount of intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, as well as dilatation of the pancreatic duct within the tail. This pancreatic mass also compresses the portal vein, splenic vein, inferior vena cava, and the superior mesenteric vein; however, each of these veins is patent. The pancreatic mass also abuts and possibly invades the posterior gastric antral wall. Multiple enlarged peripancreatic, periaortic, porta hepatic, portocaval, and gastric ligament lymph nodes are identified. A focal area of low attenuation is seen within the medial aspect of the left hepatic lobe which most likely represents focal fatty infiltration; however, metastasis cannot be entirely excluded.  This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass;however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs or the SMA, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

There is a thin rim of preserved renal parenchyma inferiorly, with hydronephrosis of the adjacent collecting system.

Colorectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death in the United States. It appears to be associated with diets high in animal fat and protein and low in fiber. Seventy percent of colorectal cancers occur in the rectosigmoid region. Rectal cancers may present with bleeding, change in bowel habits, perineal pain, and symptoms of invasion of adjacent organs including hematuria, urinary frequency, or vaginal fistulas. Surgical removal is the only effective therapy. Anterior resection with anastomosis to the rectal stump is performed for upper rectal tumors and a combined abdominal and perineal resection with a permanent colostomy for distal rectal lesions. On CT, rectal lesions may appear as focal lobulated soft tissue masses with asymmetrical or circumferential thickening of the bowel wall. Narrowing of the lumen and bowel obstruction may be evident. Extension into pericolonic fat or adjacent structures, regional adenopathy, adrenal or liver metastases, and hydronephrosis may also be visualized. Common sites of local extension include the pelvic musculature, bladder, prostate, ovaries, and seminal vesicles.

The 4cm mass shows intense but fairly homogenous peripheral enhancement with central low attenuation. Delayed images through the liver show central filling of the large mass. The smaller mass is not visible on post contrast images. The appearance of the small lesion is grossly unchanged from the prior study when it was thought to be a hemangioma.  The liver is a common site for the metastatic spread of malignant tumors. Metatstatic lesions are the most common malignant tumor of the liver. Most arise from the colon, although they may originate from almost any primary malignancy. Liver metastases are usually multiple, well-defined, low density solid masses. When there is fatty infiltration, the masses may appear as high density solid masses. When the tumor is mucinous colon or ovarian carcinoma, melanoma, lung, or carcinoid, the tumor may have a cystic or necrotic appearance. Metastatic lesions may also be calcified. A solitary metastatic lesion may present a problem in differentiation. Thus it is necessary to consider the other possibilities such as hepatoma, hepatic adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, and cavernous hemangioma. Cavernous hemangiomas are the second most common focal mass found in the liver. They are usually asyptomatic, however when very large, may cause symptoms by pressure effect, hemorrhage, or arteriovenous shunting.

Complications of abdominal aortic aneurysm include rupture, peripheral embolization, thrombosis, and infection. The incidence of rupture increases with increasing aneurysm size above 4 cm. Rupture usually occurs into the left retroperitoneal space and rarely into the gastrointestinal tract and inferior vena cava. If a ruptured or leaking aneurysm is suspected, CT should be done with contrast enhancement. Typical findings include obscuration or anterior displacement of the aneurysm by an irregular high density mass or collection that extends into one or both perirenal spaces.

The ascending aorta and aortic arch appear normal. There is aortic dissection in the descending thoracic aorta beginning immediately distal to the arch and extending into the proximal abdominal aorta. The true lumen is compressed and false lumen is significantly thrombosed.  CT has to a large degree replaced arteriography in diagnosing aortic dissection and determining its type and location. The diagnosis is made by the demonstration of an intimal flap, displaced inward from the edge of the aorta and lying between the true and false channels. In Dailys classification, types A and B are described with type A being more common. Type A involves the ascending aorta and is usually treated surgically because of the potential for retrograde dissection. Type B involves the area distal to the left subclavian artery and is treated medically. CT is used for screening those with suspected aortic dissection and for follow-up of patients previously diagnosed with dissection. It should be performed with bolus contrast enhancement and dynamic scanning at three levels: (1) the aortic arch; (2) the proximal aortic root and descending aorta near the level of the pulmonary artery; (3) the more distal descending thoracic aorta. Newer helical CT scanners allow rapid scanning of the arch during bolus contrast injection eliminating the need for the \"three level scan\". Two passes can be made throught the aortic arch early in the contrast injection. In a patient with dissection, the intimal flap may be delineated by contrast filling both the true and false channels. One of the channels may fill slowly, thus requiring the use of images late in the sequence to make the diagnosis. A false channel that contains a clot may not opacify and in such a case, may be difficult to distinguish from a clot-filled atherosclerotic aneurysm. Dissections, however, are usually longer than clot-filled aneurysms and may produce an abrupt change in aortic caliber and thickening of the aortic wall. Streak artifacts due to wall motion or vascular pulsations may mimic an intimal flap. Streak artifacts are usually seen in the descending aorta adjacent to the left heart.

Other sites include the internal iliac veins, the inferior vena cava, upper extremities, mural thrombus within the right heart, renal veins and tumor emboli. Ventilation and perfusion scintography and pulmonary arteriography are used to diagnose PE. CT may be used in patients who are at high risk for complications of arteriography. On CT, emboli appear as intraluminal filling defects. There may be evidence of infarction, such as wedge-shaped areas of parenchymal consolidation adjacent to a pleural surface. Linear strands may extend from the lesion toward the hilum, and the periphery of the lesion may enhance after intravenous administration of contrast, probably due to collateral flow.

Exam 1:A large amount of portal venous gas is present. The remainder of the liver is unremarkable. The spleen is mildly enlarged. Pneumatosis affects the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. It is worse within the jejunum and proximal ileum. The distal ileum and colon demonstrate no evidence of pneumatosis. There is also thickening of the small bowel wall with marked enhancement. A small amount of free fluid is present within the gutters and now within the pelvis. The patient has free intraperitoneal air. The superior mesenteric artery demonstrates thrombus within its proximal lumen. Contrast does fill the mid and distal portions of the SMA. The celiac axis appears widely patent. The infrarenal aorta has an irregular lumen, consistent with atherosclerotic disease. The infrahepatic IVC is obliterated.

There are multiple loops of dilated fluid-filled small bowel with long segments of pneumatosis. The colon is edematous but no definite pneumatosis is seen. The duodenum does not appear to be affected. There is no definite abscess formation or free intraperitoneal air. A small amount of intraperitoneal fluid is present.

Colorectal adenocarcinoma is one of the most common neoplasms encountered in the affluent countries of the Western world. The disease exhibits a peak age incidence in the sixth and seventh decades. It is associated with increased serum concentration of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Predisposing factors for colorectal cancer include adenomatous polyps, inherited multiple polyposis syndromes, long-standing ulcerative colitis, close relatives with colon cancer, and a low fiber, high animal fat diet. Colorectal cancer varies in gross presentation according to the region of the colon involved. Carcinoma of the rectosigmoid colon usually presents in an annular manner, often producing early bowel obstruction. Carcinoma of the right colon, however, usually does not obstruct early and frequently presents with iron deficiency anemia secondary to chronic blood loss. Colon cancer spreads by direct extension due to penetration of the colon wall, lymphatic drainage to regional nodes, through the portal system to the liver, and intraperitoneal seeding. Although barium enemas and colonoscopy are the primary methods used to initially diagnose colorectal cancer, CT is an excellent procedure for the detection of recurrence.

A 53 year-old Black female who complained of a sensation of something \"dropping\" in her pelvis several months prior to imaging as well as dysuria that resolved with oral antibiotics several weeks ago. Cystoscopy done just prior to radiologic evaluation was unremarkable.  Two large radiopaque stones projecting over the lower pubic symphysis on scout film. VCUG demonstrated a posterior urethral diverticulum which contained both sontes within it. Bladder was normal. The diverticulum opening was located near the bladder neck.  The female urethra, which is homologous to the posterior urethra in the male minus the verumontanum, is approximately 4 cm long. It courses obliquely downward from the internal urethral opening and is slightly curved, although its course is normally quite variable. The urethra contains periuurethral glands (throughout its length?), and glands similar to the male prostatic glands are often also present. Most female diverticula are acquired rather than congenital and occur posteriorly in the midurethra. They are thought to result from infected periurethral glands that form abscess cavities that then rupture into the urethral lumen. Other possible causes of acquired diverticula include trauma during childbirth, instrumenation and fulguration of urethral lesions, urethral strictures or stones. Both benign and malignant tumors arising within the diverticulum itself have also been described in case reports. Acquired diverticula are thought to be present in up to 3% of asymptomatic females. Complications can include stone formation, dysuria, frequent urinary tract infections and dyspareunia, as well as post-void dribbling. Physical exam is usually normal although a palpable, bulging mass is occasionally present and this was the case with the patient presented here in whom one of her diverticular stones had actually begun to erode through the diverticular wall which was clearly visible at her introitus. Other than location, the differentiation between congenital versus acqured diverticula can be very difficult. Congenital diverticula usually occur in the anterior urethra and are almost exclusively a male phenomenon. The appearance of urethral diverticula can be quite variable dependingon the location and the patients sex as well. They can be multiple, or multilocular, saccular, tubular or ovoid and can have a variable number of openings into the urethral lumen. In females, the diverticulum is usually short-necked and tubular or oval. Cystoscopy is not very sensitive, missing up to 60% of cases.

The ascending aorta and aortic arch appear normal. There is aortic dissection in the descending thoracic aorta beginning immediately distal to the arch and extending into the proximal abdominal aorta. The true lumen is compressed and false lumen is significantly thrombosed.  CT has to a large degree replaced arteriography in diagnosing aortic dissection and determining its type and location. The diagnosis is made by the demonstration of an intimal flap, displaced inward from the edge of the aorta and lying between the true and false channels. In Dailys classification, types A and B are described with type A being more common. Type A involves the ascending aorta and is usually treated surgically because of the potential for retrograde dissection. Type B involves the area distal to the left subclavian artery and is treated medically. CT is used for screening those with suspected aortic dissection and for follow-up of patients previously diagnosed with dissection. It should be performed with bolus contrast enhancement and dynamic scanning at three levels: (1) the aortic arch; (2) the proximal aortic root and descending aorta near the level of the pulmonary artery; (3) the more distal descending thoracic aorta. Newer helical CT scanners allow rapid scanning of the arch during bolus contrast injection eliminating the need for the \"three level scan\". Two passes can be made throught the aortic arch early in the contrast injection. In a patient with dissection, the intimal flap may be delineated by contrast filling both the true and false channels. One of the channels may fill slowly, thus requiring the use of images late in the sequence to make the diagnosis. A false channel that contains a clot may not opacify and in such a case, may be difficult to distinguish from a clot-filled atherosclerotic aneurysm. Dissections, however, are usually longer than clot-filled aneurysms and may produce an abrupt change in aortic caliber and thickening of the aortic wall. Streak artifacts due to wall motion or vascular pulsations may mimic an intimal flap. Streak artifacts are usually seen in the descending aorta adjacent to the left heart.

This is a 34 year old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and multiple episodes of esophageal variceal bleeding and pancreatitis. The patient presents today with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain and severe weight loss.  Currently, there is extensive patchy low attenuation throughout the liver which has progressed considerably compared to a previous study. This is most consistent with diffuse infiltrative hepatocellular carcinoma. Other findings include significantly increased degree of ascites compared to the previous study. There is also a focally dilated loop of distal small bowel of uncertain significance. Extensive edema of the colon wall, mesentery and omentum is seen. Extensive varices are again identified.  Liver cirrhosis is characterized by a generalized disorganization of hepatic archictecture with scarring and nodule formation. Other sequelae include liver cell damage, regenerative activity, and generalized fibrosis resulting in a nodular pattern. There is an increased incidence of hepatocelluar carcinoma associated with cirrhosis of the liver. Causes of cirrhosis include prolonged alcohol intake, viral hepatitis, biliary obstruction, Wilsons disease, and heart failure with long-standing chronic passive congestion of the liver. Alcoholic (Laennecs, nutritional) cirrhosis is the most frequently occurring form of the disorder. Clinical manifestations of the disease include jaundice, hypoalbuminemia, coagulation factor deficiencies, hypersplenism, and intrahepatic scarring with increased portal venous pressure. The increase in portal venous pressure can lead to esophageal varices, rectal hemorrhiods, periumbilical venous collaterals (caput medusae), and splenomegaly. Morphologically, the liver may be enlarged or small and shrunken depending upon the progression of the disease. The nodular pattern is most often micronodular in alcoholic cirrhosis. Hepatic architecture is obscured by fibrous bands surrounding nodules of distorted liver cell plates. The fibrous bands contain proliferating bile ducts and inflammatory cells. In the final stages of cirrhosis the nodules become larger and more irregular resulting in a scarred, shrunken liver referred to as a \"hobnail liver\". Patients with cirrhosis of the liver often present with the following radiological findings. Fatty infiltration with hepatomegaly can be seen in the early stages of cirrhosis. Other characteristic findings include non-uniform attenuation due to chronic fatty infiltration and irregular fibrosis, irregular lobulated hepatic contour due to areas of atrophy and nodular regeneration, intrahepatic regenerating nodules, atrophy of the right lobe and hypertrophy of the left and caudate lobes, decreased liver volume accompanying chronic cirrhosis, increased size and prominence of the intrahepatic fissure due to shrunken liver parenchyma, signs of portal hypertension, and ascites. A ratio comparing the sizes of the caudate lobe and right lobe is a good diagnostic indicator of patients with cirrhosis. The caudate is measured transversely from the medial aspect of the caudate to the lateral aspect of the main portal vein. The right lobe is measured from this same point at the portal vein to the right lateral margin of the liver. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio greater than 0.65 provides 96% confidence in the diagnosis of cirrhosis. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio less then 0.6 makes cirrhosis unlikely, whereas a ratio of 0.37 is the average for normal liverso", "image_path": ["00132971.jpg"], "split": "train"}, {"id": "00132937.jpg", "report": "RADIOLOGY: GASTROINTESTINAL: GI:  COLON CA, WITH HEPATIC METS.

Colorectal adenocarcinoma is one of the most common neoplasms encountered in the affluent countries of the Western world. The disease exhibits a peak age incidence in the sixth and seventh decades. It is associated with increased serum concentration of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Predisposing factors for colorectal cancer include adenomatous polyps, inherited multiple polyposis syndromes, long-standing ulcerative colitis, close relatives with colon cancer, and a low fiber, high animal fat diet. Colorectal cancer varies in gross presentation according to the region of the colon involved. Carcinoma of the rectosigmoid colon usually presents in an annular manner, often producing early bowel obstruction. Carcinoma of the right colon, however, usually does not obstruct early and frequently presents with iron deficiency anemia secondary to chronic blood loss. Colon cancer spreads by direct extension due to penetration of the colon wall, lymphatic drainage to regional nodes, through the portal system to the liver, and intraperitoneal seeding. Although barium enemas and colonoscopy are the primary methods used to initially diagnose colorectal cancer, CT is an excellent procedure for the detection of recurrence.

No intimal flap is noted in the ascending aorta. There is minimal irregularity of the thoracic aortic wall near the left subclavian region along with para-aortic hematoma which has CT attenuation value of 45-50 HU. The celiac, SMA, and right renal artery appear to arise from the true lumen whereas the left renal artery appears to arise from the false lumen.  CT has to a large degree replaced arteriography in diagnosing aortic dissection and determining its type and location. The diagnosis is made by the demonstration of an intimal flap, displaced inward from the edge of the aorta and lying between the true and false channels. In Dailys classification, types A and B are described with type A being more common. Type A involves the ascending aorta and is usually treated surgically because of the potential for retrograde dissection. Type B involves the area distal to the left subclavian artery and is treated medically. CT is used for screening those with suspected aortic dissection and for follow-up of patients previously diagnosed with dissection. It should be performed with bolus contrast enhancement and dynamic scanning at three levels: (1) the aortic arch; (2) the proximal aortic root and descending aorta near the level of the pulmonary artery; (3) the more distal descending thoracic aorta. Newer helical CT scanners allow rapid scanning of the arch during bolus contrast injection eliminating the need for the \"three level scan\". Two passes can be made throught the aortic arch early in the contrast injection. In a patient with dissection, the intimal flap may be delineated by contrast filling both the true and false channels. One of the channels may fill slowly, thus requiring the use of images late in the sequence to make the diagnosis. A false channel that contains a clot may not opacify and in such a case, may be difficult to distinguish from a clot-filled atherosclerotic aneurysm. Dissections, however, are usually longer than clot-filled aneurysms and may produce an abrupt change in aortic caliber and thickening of the aortic wall.

CT is done is to rule out abscess or possible perforated viscus. No prior abdominal CTs for comparison.  The liver has a markedly diffuse, heterogeneous parenchymal density with large regions in the anterior and posterior aspects of the right liver lobe which are diffusely hypodense persistently even on delayed images. This appearance raises the possibility of hepatic necrosis. In the enhancing regions, there is a diffuse punctate heterogeneity which is suggestive of hepatic cirrhosis. There are multiple, small gallstones in the region of the gallbladder neck. Common duct appears non-dilated. There is diffuse circumferential gastrointestinal wall thickening from the visualized portions of the lower esophagus inferiorly to the rectum. This is most prominent in the stomach and duodenal regions. There is a small amount of ascites, noted most around the anterior aspect of the right liver lobe and in the pelvis. A moderate degree of fluid is present in the anterior pararenal space predominantly in a peripancreatic distribution and extending into the bilateral anterior pararenal fascial locations and more prominently in the right ascending colonic region. There is diffuse increased mesenteric streaky changes consistent with congestion. An umbilical varix is identified.  Liver cirrhosis is characterized by a generalized disorganization of hepatic archictecture with scarring and nodule formation. Other sequelae include liver cell damage, regenerative activity, and generalized fibrosis resulting in a nodular pattern. There is an increased incidence of hepatocelluar carcinoma associated with cirrhosis of the liver. Causes of cirrhosis include prolonged alcohol intake, viral hepatitis, biliary obstruction, Wilsons disease, and heart failure with long-standing chronic passive congestion of the liver. Alcoholic (Laennecs, nutritional) cirrhosis is the most frequently occurring form of the disorder. Clinical manifestations of the disease include jaundice, hypoalbuminemia, coagulation factor deficiencies, hyperstrinism, and intrahepatic scarring with increased portal venous pressure. The increase in portal venous pressure can lead to esophageal varices, rectal hemorrhiods, periumbilical venous collaterals (caput medusae), and splenomegaly. Morphologically, the liver may be enlarged or small and shrunken depending upon the progression of the disease. The nodular pattern is most often micronodular in alcoholic cirrhosis. Hepatic architecture is obscured by fibrous bands surrounding nodules of distorted liver cell plates. The fibrous bands contain proliferating bile ducts and inflammatory cells. In the final stages of cirrhosis the nodules become larger and more irregular resulting in a scarred, shrunken liver referred to as a \"hobnail liver\". Patients with cirrhosis of the liver often present with the following radiological findings. Fatty infiltration with hepatomegaly can be seen in the early stages of cirrhosis. Other characteristic findings include non-uniform attenuation due to chronic fatty infiltration and irregular fibrosis, irregular lobulated hepatic contour due to areas of atrophy and nodular regeneration, intrahepatic regenerating nodules, atrophy of the right lobe and hypertrophy of the left and caudate lobes, decreased liver volume accompanying chronic cirrhosis, increased size and prominence of the intrahepatic fissure due to shrunken liver parenchyma, signs of portal hypertension, and ascites. A ratio comparing the sizes of the caudate lobe and right lobe is a good diagnostic indicator of patients with cirrhosis. The caudate is measured transversely from the medial aspect of the caudate to the lateral aspect of the main portal vein. The right lobe is measured from this same point at the portal vein to the right lateral margin of the liver. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio greater than 0.65 provides 96% confidence in the diagnosis of cirrhosis. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio less then 0.6 makes cirrhosis unlikely, whereas a ratio of 0.37 is the average for normal livers", "image_path": ["00133440.jpg"], "split": "train"}, {"id": "00134798.jpg", "report": "RADIOLOGY: GASTROINTESTINAL: GI:  DUODENAL INJURY, GREATER OMENTUM HEMATOMA, LARGE LEFT OVARIAN CYST.  22 year old female in MVA.

Recurrent epigastric pain and nausea for twelve months. Outside ultrasound showed multiple hepatic metastases and cholelithiasis.  Multiple low density lesions are scattered widely throughout both lobes of the liver. Many of the larger lesions have an enhancing rim. In the tail of the pancreas there is a hypodense mass which measures 2.5 x 3 cm. There is no lymphadenopathy.  This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass; however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs or the SMA, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

Hemangiomas are the most common benign tumors of the liver. They are usually found in the right hepatic lobe and are frequently subcapsular in location. The CT appearance of hemangiomas after a bolus injection of iodinated contrast material with dynamic scanning demonstrates a dense peripheral enhancement, which eccentrically fills in toward the center of the lesion on delayed scan.

The patient is a 59 year old black male with alcoholic cirrhosis and known hepatocellular carcinoma.  The study is compared with prior CT exam. The liver again has a cirrhotic configuration and there is now an 8 x 12 cm heterogeneous mass present in the medial segment of the left hepatic lobe. A smaller, 2 x 3 cm, hypodense lesion is also noted to be present in the posterior aspect of the lateral segment of the left hepatic lobe. Portal vein occlusion is present with cavernous transformation. Splenomegaly is again noted with a large number of splenorenal, splenogastric and esophageal varices. The enlarged spleen and varices displace the left kidney as on previous exam. The gallbladder wall is edematous without evidence of pericholecystic fluid.  Liver cirrhosis is characterized by a generalized disorganization of hepatic archictecture with scarring and nodule formation. Other sequelae include liver cell damage, regenerative activity, and generalized fibrosis resulting in a nodular pattern. There is an increased incidence of hepatocelluar carcinoma associated with cirrhosis of the liver. Causes of cirrhosis include prolonged alcohol intake, viral hepatitis, biliary obstruction, Wilsons disease, and heart failure with long-standing chronic passive congestion of the liver. Alcoholic (Laennecs, nutritional) cirrhosis is the most frequently occurring form of the disorder. Clinical manifestations of the disease include jaundice, hypoalbuminemia, coagulation factor deficiencies, hyperstrinism, and intrahepatic scarring with increased portal venous pressure. The increase in portal venous pressure can lead to esophageal varices, rectal hemorrhiods, periumbilical venous collaterals (caput medusae), and splenomegaly. Morphologically, the liver may be enlarged or small and shrunken depending upon the progression of the disease. The nodular pattern is most often micronodular in alcoholic cirrhosis. Hepatic architecture is obscured by fibrous bands surrounding nodules of distorted liver cell plates. The fibrous bands contain proliferating bile ducts and inflammatory cells. In the final stages of cirrhosis the nodules become larger and more irregular resulting in a scarred, shrunken liver referred to as a \"hobnail liver\". Patients with cirrhosis of the liver often present with the following radiological findings. Fatty infiltration with hepatomegaly can be seen in the early stages of cirrhosis. Other characteristic findings include non-uniform attenuation due to chronic fatty infiltration and irregular fibrosis, irregular lobulated hepatic contour due to areas of atrophy and nodular regeneration, intrahepatic regenerating nodules, atrophy of the right lobe and hypertrophy of the left and caudate lobes, decreased liver volume accompanying chronic cirrhosis, increased size and prominence of the intrahepatic fissure due to shrunken liver parenchyma, signs of portal hypertension, and ascites. A ratio comparing the sizes of the caudate lobe and right lobe is a good diagnostic indicator of patients with cirrhosis. The caudate is measured transversely from the medial aspect of the caudate to the lateral aspect of the main portal vein. The right lobe is measured from this same point at the portal vein to the right lateral margin of the liver. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio greater than 0.65 provides 96% confidence in the diagnosis of cirrhosis. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio less then 0.6 makes cirrhosis unlikely, whereas a ratio of 0.37 is the average for normal livers.", "image_path": ["00133514.jpg"], "split": "train"}, {"id": "00135435.jpg", "report": "RADIOLOGY: VASCULAR:  INJURY TO THE PROXIMAL RIGHT RENAL ARTERY .RIGHT L4 TRANSVERSE PROCESS FRACTURE.

The patient is a 61-year-old female with jaundice and abdominal pain.  There is intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation noted with stent placement in the common bile duct. The proximal tip of the stent appears to be in the right hepatic duct and the distal tip is within the 2nd portion of the duodenum. A well-circumscribed rounded fluid collection is also noted in the region of the porta hepatis consistent with dilatation of the cystic duct remnant. No focal hepatic lesions are identified. Low attenuation tumor in the head of the pancreas is noted surrounding the celiac axis and SMA with mild narrowing. Multiple peripancreatic lymph nodes are noted; the largest measuring 3 x 2 cm. Surgical clips are noted in the gallbladder fossa, consistent with prior cholecystectomy.  This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass;however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs or the SMA, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

A more well defined fluid collection in continuity with the second and third segment of the duodenum suggests that fluid may have dissected within the serosa of the second and third duodenal segments. There are strands of high attenuation within this fluid collection on the pre-contrast study, suggesting hemorrhage. There is moderate gaseous and fluid distention of the stomach suggesting at least partial obstruction at the duodenum. A moderate left pleural effusion with associated left lower lobe atelectasis is present. The liver is diffusely diminished in attenuation without evidence of focal lesion. Strandy opacities are present throughout the mesentery consistent with congestion and/or inflammation. A small amount of ascites is seen within the pelvis. Incidental note is made of a left simple renal cyst and gunshot fragments within the left paraspinal tissues.  Pancreatitis is thought to result from inappropriate intrapancreatic activation of proteases, causing autodigestion of the gland and leading to pancreatic inflammatory disease. The two most common causes of acute pancreatitis are ethanol abuse and choledocholithiasis. Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is made on the basis of the history, physical findings, and an elevation in the serum amylase. Since, however, serum amylase may be normal in 1/3 of patients having alcoholic pancreatitis, CT may be needed to confirm the diagnosis. CT findings include diffuse or focal glandular enlargement, contour irregularity, focal irregular areas of decreased attenuation secondary to necrosis or edema, and changes in the peripancreatic areolar tissues, fat, and parietal peritoneal planes. Hemorrhagic pancreatitis is an important manifestation of acute pancreatitis that may lead to hypovolemic shock and death. This may appear on CT as pancreatic and peripancreatic fluid collections with areas of high density, indicative of blood clots within the bed of the pancreas. These fluid collections may mimic pseudocysts, however, fluid collections due to hemorrhagic pancreatitis differ in that they change in size, shape, and location while pseudocysts tend to be more permanent. Typical CT findings of pseudocysts show low-density fluid masses with well-defined walls of variable thickness. Calcifications may occur within the pseudocysts. Intramural pseudocysts in the stomach, duodenum, and colon are relatively rare but do occur. These most commonly involve the posterolateral wall of the second part of the duodenum and may produce obstruction of the the bowel lumen.

Lesions of the rectum and rectosigmoid are seen as asymmetric or circumferential thickening of the bowel wall with deformation and narrowing of the lumen. Other findings include: extension of the tumor intopericolonic fat, invasion of adjacent structures, lymphadenopathy, adrenal or liver metastases, hydronephrosis, ascites, and masses in the abdominal wall, omentum or mesentery. Common sites of local extension from the rectosigmoid (as seen by marginal obscuration) include pelvic muscles, bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, and ovaries. Hepatic metastases vary in their CT apperance. Borders may be sharp, ill-defined, or nodular with round, ovoid, or irregular shape. Attenuation is usually lower than that of the surrounding liver both before and after contrast administration (although mets may become iso- or hyperdense after contrast).

Pancreatic pseudocysts are usually the sequelae of pancreatitis, most often associated with the subacute or chronic varieties. Peripancreatic fluid collections in the setting of acute pancreatitis are not pseduocysts. A pseudocyst is a cystic structure with a thick, fibrous wall and is not lined with epithelium (hence, it is not a true cyst). A pseudocyst may have a persistent connection to the pancreatic duct which may be demonstrated by ERCP. Typically, an uncomplicated pseudocyst will have a homogeneous water density. Increased density or inhomogeneity indicate some complicating factor such as hemorrhage or infection.

ERCP performed one day prior demonstrated irregular stricture of pancreatic duct with dilatation of duct proximal to stricture.  There is an irregular pancreatic head mass with ill-defined margins measuring about 3 cm in diameter. This mass encases the celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery. The mass also encases and obstructs the left renal vein and superior mesenteric vein. Numerous varices are identified as a result of these venous obstructions. A moderate amount of biliary ductal dilatation is present. Pneumobilia secondary to recent ERCP is noted.  This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass; however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs or the SMA, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

Multiple fluid filled cyst-like structures are seen throughout the pancreas, the largest of which measures 5.0 x 6.0 cm.  Fatty infiltration of the liver is one of the most common abnormalities diagnosed on CT of the liver. Fatty change is the response of the liver to various insults such as alcoholism, diabetes, obesity, steroid therapy, and malnutrition. In general, fatty change lowers the attenuation of the liver parenchyma causing hepatic vessels to stand out. While the attenuation of normal liver is equal to or greater than that of normal spleen, liver that has undergone fatty change appears more lucent than normal spleen. Fatty infiltration may involve the liver diffusely, focally, or multifocally. The diffuse pattern is the most common. CT shows decreased attenuation of the entire liver with the vessels standing out prominently following administration of contrast. The liver is usually enlarged. In focal involvement, a fan-shaped area may show fatty change and low attenuation while the rest of the liver appears normal, while in multifocal involvement, there are multiple patchy areas of fatty change which may appear similar to metastases or hepatoma.

Although common bile duct stones may form de novo in the biliary tree, most come from the gallbladder. CT is about 95% accurate in diagnosing biliary obstruction. CT diagnosis is based on the findings of dilated intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts. This dilatation may be absent in cirrhosis, cholangitis, or periductal fibrosis, thereby creating a false-negative. Dilated intrahepatic ducts will appear as branching tubular or round structures of low density enlarging as they approach the porta hepatis. Dilatation of the common bile duct to greater than 7mm in diameter also indicates obstruction. CT is also useful in differentiating causes of obstruction. Abrupt tapering of a dilated duct suggests a malignant process, such as pancreatic carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma, whereas gradual tapering is more commonly seen with an inflammatory process such as chronic pancreatitis. Gallstones are visualized as calcified or soft tissue density structures within the bile duct surrounded by lower density bile creating a target sign.

The right kidney shows heterogeneous enhancement in the anterior aspect of the right kidney in the mid to upper portion. There is a stent extending from the right renal pelvis into the bladder. The distal ureter is thickened at the level of the sacrum with soft tissue density around the stent. There is no abdominal or pelvic adenopathy.  85% of renal neoplasms are renal cell carcinomas, most commonly occurring in men, at ages 50-70, and usually involving one kidney. Only 2% are bilateral. Metastases are present at the time of diagnosis in 40% of cases. Since surgery is the only cure, early detection and accurate staging are important. The most common CT finding is a solid mass although low density areas due to hemorrhage or necrosis may be present. Cystic and multicystic forms may be seen. Stippled central or \"eggshell\" peripheral calcifications are seen in 10%. These tumors are usually hypervascular which may be evidenced by the presence of tortuous vessels in the perirenal fat. Tumor growth into the renal vein occurs in 30% of the time and into the inferior vena cava 5-10%. Venous invasion does not preclude surgical resection, but its identification is crucial to surgical planning. Renal cell carcinomas may spread locally to perirenal fat and adjacent organs. This is seen as strand or nodules of low density. Enlargement of renal hilar, pericaval, and periaortic nodes to 15mm or more indicates lymphatic spread. Hematogenous spread to the lung, bone, liver, adrenals, and the opposite kidney may occur. Distant metastases occasionally disappear with the removal of the primary tumor. Late appearance of metastases as long as 20 years following \"cure\" is also seen. Uroepithelial tumors account for 5 to 10% of renal tumors. 85% of these are transitional cell carcinomas while the remainder are usually squamous cell carcinomas. Hematuria is common, and these tumors usually present earlier than renal cell carcinomas. Most transitional cell tumors have a papillary growth pattern and are attched to the mucosa by a stalk. Non-papillary tumors are flat or nodular and usually agressive. They more commonly cause strictures in the collecting system and ureters. CT typically shows a low attenuating (15-30H) soft tissue mass within the renal pelvis or renal sinus, distorting and compressing the collecting system. Transitional cell carcinoma is readily differentiated from renal calculi on CT images since its numbers are much less than even radiolucent calculi (150-200H).

Most commonly this occurs in the tips and inferior surface of the temporal and frontal lobes, or in the parasagittal regions. MRI is frequently more sensitive in detecting these injuries.

There is aortic dissection of the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta starting near the origin of left subclavian artery and extending down to the level of aortobifem bypass graft. No intimal flap is noted in the ascending aorta. There is minimal irregularity of the thoracic aortic wall near the left subclavian region along with para-aortic hematoma which has CT attenuation value of 45-50 HU. The celiac, SMA, and right renal artery appear to arise from the true lumen whereas the left renal artery appears to arise from the false lumen.  CT has to a large degree replaced arteriography in diagnosing aortic dissection and determining its type and location. The diagnosis is made by the demonstration of an intimal flap, displaced inward from the edge of the aorta and lying between the true and false channels. In Dailys classification, types A and B are described with type A being more common. Type A involves the ascending aorta and is usually treated surgically because of the potential for retrograde dissection. Type B involves the area distal to the left subclavian artery and is treated medically. CT is used for screening those with suspected aortic dissection and for follow-up of patients previously diagnosed with dissection. It should be performed with bolus contrast enhancement and dynamic scanning at three levels: (1) the aortic arch; (2) the proximal aortic root and descending aorta near the level of the pulmonary artery; (3) the more distal descending thoracic aorta. Newer helical CT scanners allow rapid scanning of the arch during bolus contrast injection eliminating the need for the \"three level scan\". Two passes can be made throught the aortic arch early in the contrast injection. In a patient with dissection, the intimal flap may be delineated by contrast filling both the true and false channels. One of the channels may fill slowly, thus requiring the use of images late in the sequence to make the diagnosis. A false channel that contains a clot may not opacify and in such a case, may be difficult to distinguish from a clot-filled atherosclerotic aneurysm. Dissections, however, are usually longer than clot-filled aneurysms and may produce an abrupt change in aortic caliber and thickening of the aortic wall. Streak artifacts due to wall motion or vascular pulsations may mimic an intimal flap. Streak artifacts are usually seen in the descending aorta adjacent to the left heart.

The right kidney shows heterogeneous enhancement in the anterior aspect of the right kidney in the mid to upper portion. There is a stent extending from the right renal pelvis into the bladder. The distal ureter is thickened at the level of the sacrum with soft tissue density around the stent. There is no abdominal or pelvic adenopathy.  85% of renal neoplasms are renal cell carcinomas, most commonly occurring in men, at ages 50-70, and usually involving one kidney. Only 2% are bilateral. Metastases are present at the time of diagnosis in 40% of cases. Since surgery is the only cure, early detection and accurate staging are important. The most common CT finding is a solid mass although low density areas due to hemorrhage or necrosis may be present. Cystic and multicystic forms may be seen. Stippled central or \"eggshell\" peripheral calcifications are seen in 10%. These tumors are usually hypervascular which may be evidenced by the presence of tortuous vessels in the perirenal fat. Tumor growth into the renal vein occurs in 30% of the time and into the inferior vena cava 5-10%. Venous invasion does not preclude surgical resection, but its identification is crucial to surgical planning. Renal cell carcinomas may spread locally to perirenal fat and adjacent organs. This is seen as strand or nodules of low density. Enlargement of renal hilar, pericaval, and periaortic nodes to 15mm or more indicates lymphatic spread. Hematogenous spread to the lung, bone, liver, adrenals, and the opposite kidney may occur. Distant metastases occasionally disappear with the removal of the primary tumor. Late appearance of metastases as long as 20 years following \"cure\" is also seen. Uroepithelial tumors account for 5 to 10% of renal tumors. 85% of these are transitional cell carcinomas while the remainder are usually squamous cell carcinomas. Hematuria is common, and these tumors usually present earlier than renal cell carcinomas. Most transitional cell tumors have a papillary growth pattern and are attched to the mucosa by a stalk. Non-papillary tumors are flat or nodular and usually agressive. They more commonly cause strictures in the collecting system and ureters. CT typically shows a low attenuating (15-30H) soft tissue mass within the renal pelvis or renal sinus, distorting and compressing the collecting system. Transitional cell carcinoma is readily differentiated from renal calculi on CT images since its numbers are much less than even radiolucent calculi (150-200H).

A cystic lesion within the tail of the pancreas most likely represents a pseudocyst secondary to pancreatic duct obstruction by the mass.

There is an irregular area of mixed predominantly low attenuation involving large wedge of tissue anteriorly and also extending upward toward the lateral upper splenic margin. Previously identified infarction in the lateral lower pole has resolved leaving a small scar. There is a trace of pelvic fluid.  Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), also referred to as chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL), is a neoplastic clonal proliferation of myeloid stem cells. CML is characterized on a molecular level by a reciprocal chromosomal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, resulting in the formation of the Philadelphia chromosome. Other characteristics of CML include marked leukocytosis, with white cell counts varying from 50,000 to 200,000/?L; leukemic cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow, mainly middle- to-late myeloid (granulocytic) precursor cells, including myelocytes, metamyelocytes, bands, and segmented forms; small numbers of blasts and promyelocytes; the Philadelphia chromosome, found in granulocytic and erythroid precursor cells and megakaryocytes; marked reduction in leukocyte alkaline phosphatase activity in the leukemic leukocyte. CML presents clinically with prominent splenomegaly and modestly enlarged liver and lymph nodes. The peak incidence of the disease is in the middle-age population (ages 35-50). In most cases the disease terminates in an accelerated phase known as a \"blastic crisis\" which is signaled by an increasing number of blast cells and promyelocytes. CT findings of CML include splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and enlarged lymph nodes. Splenomegaly is defined as spleen size greater than 12 cm in the long axis and extension below the costal margin or substantially below the upper pole of the left kidney. Splenic infarction, a finding also asscoiated with CML, classically appers as a wedge-shaped hypodense area. However, the wedge shape is often obscured by the fusion of multiple infarcts of various sizes. The key finding is extension of the low density area to the capsule of the spleen without causing mass effect. The infarcted areas progressively atrophy, eventually resulting in notching of the splenic contour and occasionally in calcification.

Seventy percent of colorectal cancers occur in the rectosigmoid region. Rectal cancers may present with bleeding, change in bowel habits, perineal pain, and symptoms of invasion of adjacent organs including hematuria, urinary frequency, or vaginal fistulas. Surgical removal is the only effective therapy. Anterior resection with anastomosis to the rectal stump is performed for upper rectal tumors and a combined abdominal and perineal resection with a permanent colostomy for distal rectal lesions.

Prognosis is very poor with a median survival of one year. CT is helpful in establishing the extent of the tumor. Malignant mesothelioma appears as an irregular or nodular pleural thickening surrounding the lung.

CT diagnosis is based on the findings of dilated intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts. This dilatation may be absent in cirrhosis, cholangitis, or periductal fibrosis, thereby creating a false-negative. Dilated intrahepatic ducts will appear as branching tubular or round structures of low density enlarging as they approach the porta hepatis. Dilatation of the common bile duct to greater than 7mm in diameter also indicates obstruction. CT is also useful in differentiating causes of obstruction. Abrupt tapering of a dilated duct suggests a malignant process, such as pancreatic carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma, whereas gradual tapering is more commonly seen with an inflammatory process such as chronic pancreatitis. Gallstones are visualized as calcified or soft tissue density structures within the bile duct surrounded by lower density bile creating a target sign.

This is an 88-year-old female who presented with jaundice. A pancreatic head mass was seen on ultrasound. CT was done to further evaluate this mass.  A large 10 cm x 7 cm heterogenous mass demonstrating both cystic and solid components appears to be arising from the pancreatic head. There is marked dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct. The body and tail of the pancreas is atrophic. This pancreatic mass encases the SMA with irregularity and narrowing of the SMA consistent with invasion. The SMV and IMV are obliterated by the tumor mass. The portal vein is occluded as well. No definite hepatic metastases are identified, however, small areas of metastasis may be missed as there are breathing artifacts.  This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass; however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs or the SMA, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

The most common finding on CT is adenopathy with conglomeration of enlarged nodes to form multilobular masses which encase vessels, displace organs, and obstruct ureters. The accuracy of CT in detecting lymphoma ranges from 68-100%*. False positives usually result from confusion with unopacified bowel loops or normal vascular structures and misinterpretation of lymphadenopathy due to benign inflammatory disease as malignancy.

This is an 88-year-old female who presented with jaundice. A pancreatic head mass was seen on ultrasound. CT was done to further evaluate this mass.  A large 10 cm x 7 cm heterogenous mass demonstrating both cystic and solid components appears to be arising from the pancreatic head. There is marked dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct. The body and tail of the pancreas is atrophic. This pancreatic mass encases the SMA with irregularity and narrowing of the SMA consistent with invasion. The SMV and IMV are obliterated by the tumor mass. The portal vein is occluded as well. No definite hepatic metastases are identified, however, small areas of metastasis may be missed as there are breathing artifacts.  This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass; however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs or the SMA, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

Multiple fluid filled cyst-like structures are seen throughout the pancreas, the largest of which measures 5.0 x 6.0 cm.  Fatty infiltration of the liver is one of the most common abnormalities diagnosed on CT of the liver. Fatty change is the response of the liver to various insults such as alcoholism, diabetes, obesity, steroid therapy, and malnutrition. In general, fatty change lowers the attenuation of the liver parenchyma causing hepatic vessels to stand out. While the attenuation of normal liver is equal to or greater than that of normal spleen, liver that has undergone fatty change appears more lucent than normal spleen. Fatty infiltration may involve the liver diffusely, focally, or multifocally. The diffuse pattern is the most common. CT shows decreased attenuation of the entire liver with the vessels standing out prominently following administration of contrast. The liver is usually enlarged. In focal involvement, a fan-shaped area may show fatty change and low attenuation while the rest of the liver appears normal, while in multifocal involvement, there are multiple patchy areas of fatty change which may appear similar to metastases or hepatoma.

This is a 34 year old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and multiple episodes of esophageal variceal bleeding and pancreatitis. The patient presents today with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain and severe weight loss.  Currently, there is extensive patchy low attenuation throughout the liver which has progressed considerably compared to a previous study. This is most consistent with diffuse infiltrative hepatocellular carcinoma. Other findings include significantly increased degree of ascites compared to the previous study. There is also a focally dilated loop of distal small bowel of uncertain significance. Extensive edema of the colon wall, mesentery and omentum is seen. Extensive varices are again identified.  Liver cirrhosis is characterized by a generalized disorganization of hepatic archictecture with scarring and nodule formation. Other sequelae include liver cell damage, regenerative activity, and generalized fibrosis resulting in a nodular pattern. There is an increased incidence of hepatocelluar carcinoma associated with cirrhosis of the liver. Causes of cirrhosis include prolonged alcohol intake, viral hepatitis, biliary obstruction, Wilsons disease, and heart failure with long-standing chronic passive congestion of the liver. Alcoholic (Laennecs, nutritional) cirrhosis is the most frequently occurring form of the disorder. Clinical manifestations of the disease include jaundice, hypoalbuminemia, coagulation factor deficiencies, hypersplenism, and intrahepatic scarring with increased portal venous pressure. The increase in portal venous pressure can lead to esophageal varices, rectal hemorrhiods, periumbilical venous collaterals (caput medusae), and splenomegaly. Morphologically, the liver may be enlarged or small and shrunken depending upon the progression of the disease. The nodular pattern is most often micronodular in alcoholic cirrhosis. Hepatic architecture is obscured by fibrous bands surrounding nodules of distorted liver cell plates. The fibrous bands contain proliferating bile ducts and inflammatory cells. In the final stages of cirrhosis the nodules become larger and more irregular resulting in a scarred, shrunken liver referred to as a \"hobnail liver\". Patients with cirrhosis of the liver often present with the following radiological findings. Fatty infiltration with hepatomegaly can be seen in the early stages of cirrhosis. Other characteristic findings include non-uniform attenuation due to chronic fatty infiltration and irregular fibrosis, irregular lobulated hepatic contour due to areas of atrophy and nodular regeneration, intrahepatic regenerating nodules, atrophy of the right lobe and hypertrophy of the left and caudate lobes, decreased liver volume accompanying chronic cirrhosis, increased size and prominence of the intrahepatic fissure due to shrunken liver parenchyma, signs of portal hypertension, and ascites. A ratio comparing the sizes of the caudate lobe and right lobe is a good diagnostic indicator of patients with cirrhosis. The caudate is measured transversely from the medial aspect of the caudate to the lateral aspect of the main portal vein. The right lobe is measured from this same point at the portal vein to the right lateral margin of the liver. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio greater than 0.65 provides 96% confidence in the diagnosis of cirrhosis.

There is a heterogeneously enhancing, low attenuation, solid mass involving the body and tail of the pancreas. The mass comlpletely encases the splenic artery to its origin at the celiac axis. The celiac axis itself appears encases by the mass and nodal metastases. The origin of the SMA is also encased by nodal metastases. A cystic lesion within the tail of the pancreas most likely represents a pseudocyst secondary to pancreatic duct obstruction by the mass. The mass abuts the posterior gastric wall with possible invasion. By CT, this mass appears unresectable (due to the amount of vascular encasement).  This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass;however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs or the SMA, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

Colorectal adenocarcinoma is one of the most common neoplasms encountered in the affluent countries of the Western world. The disease exhibits a peak age incidence in the sixth and seventh decades. It is associated with increased serum concentration of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Predisposing factors for colorectal cancer include adenomatous polyps, inherited multiple polyposis syndromes, long-standing ulcerative colitis, close relatives with colon cancer, and a low fiber, high animal fat diet. Colorectal cancer varies in gross presentation according to the region of the colon involved. Carcinoma of the rectosigmoid colon usually presents in an annular manner, often producing early bowel obstruction. Carcinoma of the right colon, however, usually does not obstruct early and frequently presents with iron deficiency anemia secondary to chronic blood loss. Colon cancer spreads by direct extension due to penetration of the colon wall, lymphatic drainage to regional nodes, through the portal system to the liver, and intraperitoneal seeding. Although barium enemas and colonoscopy are the primary methods used to initially diagnose colorectal cancer, CT is an excellent procedure for the detection of recurrence. CT findings of colon cancer include focal lobulated soft tissue mass in the colon, localized thickening of greater than 5 mm of the bowel wall, irregular lumen surface, extension of linear soft tissue densities or discrete mass into pericolic fat or adjacent organs, regional adenopathy, and liver metastases. Soft tissue masses visualized within the peritoneal cavity may signify metastases or recurrence of the cancer. Calcification in the primary tumor can be seen with mucinous adenocarcinoma. 85% of renal neoplasms are renal cell carcinomas, most commonly occurring in men, at ages 50-70, and usually involving one kidney. Only 2% are bilateral. Metastases are present at the time of diagnosis in 40% of cases. Since surgery is the only cure, early detection and accurate staging are important. The most common CT finding is a solid mass although low density areas due to hemorrhage or necrosis may be present. Cystic and multicystic forms may be seen. Stippled central or \"eggshell\" peripheral calcifications are seen in 10%. These tumors are usually hypervascular which may be evidenced by the presence of tortuous vessels in the perirenal fat. Tumor growth into the renal vein occurs in 30% of the time and into the inferior vena cava 5-10%. Venous invasion does not preclude surgical resection, but its identification is crucial to surgical planning. Renal cell carcinomas may spread locally to perirenal fat and adjacent organs. This is seen as strand or nodules of low density. Enlargement of renal hilar, pericaval, and periaortic nodes to 15mm or more indicates lymphatic spread. Hematogenous spread to the lung, bone, liver, adrenals, and the opposite kidney may occur. Distant metastases occasionally disappear with the removal of the primary tumor.

The right kidney, ureters, and bladder are radiographically unremarkable. Nodular enlargement is again seen in the right adrenal gland. This area measures 0.8 x 1.2cm in diameter. It is better visualized on todays examination and shows some areas of enhancement. The left adrenal gland is slightly prominent, but its adeniform contour is preserved. The renal vein is prominent but appears patent as do the other major vessels in the upper abdomen.  85% of renal neoplasms are renal cell carcinomas. They most commonly occur in men, at ages 50-70, and are usually unilateral. Only 2% are bilateral. Metastases are present at the time of diagnosis in 40% of cases. Since surgery is the only cure, early detection and accurate staging are important. Contrast-enhanced CT detects 96% of renal cell carcinomas. When IV contrast administration is contraindicated, MR is the preferred method of evaluation. The most common CT finding is a solid mass although low density areas due to hemorrhage or necrosis may be present. Strongly enhancing tumors are lower in density than renal parenchyma. Cystic and multicystic forms may be seen. Stippled central or \"eggshell\" peripheral calcifications are seen in 10%. These tumors are usually hypervascular which may be evidenced by the presence of tortuous vessels in the perirenal fat. Tumor growth into the renal vein occurs in 30% of the time and into the inferior vena cava 5-10%. Venous invasion does not preclude surgical resection, but its identification is crucial to surgical planning. CT typically shows enlarged, poorly enhancing veins which are filled with tumor thrombus seen as nodular low density within the vein. This may extend into the inferior vena cava all the way up to the right atrium. Renal cell carcinomas may spread locally to perirenal fat and adjacent organs. This is seen as strand or nodules of low density. Enlargement of renal hilar, pericaval, and periaortic nodes to 15mm or more indicates lymphatic spread.

The spleen is moderately enlarged. There is extensive diverticulosis of the colon.  Normal anatomical positioning is termed situs solitus. The cardiac apex, aortic arch, and stomach are all normally on the left. In addition, the anatomic left atrium is on the same side as the hyparterial bronchus and bilobed lung; the anatomic right atrium is on the same side as the eparterial bronchus and trilobed lung. With normal situs and levocardia, the incidence of congenital heart disease is less than 1%; with dextrocardia, the incidence rises to 95%. As shown above, situs inversus is a mirror image of normal anatomy. In situs inversus totalis, the cardiac apex, stomach and aortic arch are all on the right. Situs inversus totalis is associated with a 5-10% incidence of congenital heart disease. Situs inversus with levocardia (right-sided stomach and left-sided heart) is associated with congenital heart disease in 95% of cases, but is very rare. Kartageners syndrome may also be seen in connection with situs inversus. Kartageners syndrome represents a triad of situs inversus (seen in 50% of cases), sinusitis, and bronchiectasis.

This is a 34 year old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and multiple episodes of esophageal variceal bleeding and pancreatitis. The patient presents today with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain and severe weight loss.  Currently, there is extensive patchy low attenuation throughout the liver which has progressed considerably compared to a previous study. This is most consistent with diffuse infiltrative hepatocellular carcinoma. Other findings include significantly increased degree of ascites compared to the previous study. There is also a focally dilated loop of distal small bowel of uncertain significance. Extensive edema of the colon wall, mesentery and omentum is seen. Extensive varices are again identified.  Liver cirrhosis is characterized by a generalized disorganization of hepatic archictecture with scarring and nodule formation. Other sequelae include liver cell damage, regenerative activity, and generalized fibrosis resulting in a nodular pattern. There is an increased incidence of hepatocelluar carcinoma associated with cirrhosis of the liver. Causes of cirrhosis include prolonged alcohol intake, viral hepatitis, biliary obstruction, Wilsons disease, and heart failure with long-standing chronic passive congestion of the liver. Alcoholic (Laennecs, nutritional) cirrhosis is the most frequently occurring form of the disorder. Clinical manifestations of the disease include jaundice, hypoalbuminemia, coagulation factor deficiencies, hypersplenism, and intrahepatic scarring with increased portal venous pressure. The increase in portal venous pressure can lead to esophageal varices, rectal hemorrhiods, periumbilical venous collaterals (caput medusae), and splenomegaly. Morphologically, the liver may be enlarged or small and shrunken depending upon the progression of the disease. The nodular pattern is most often micronodular in alcoholic cirrhosis. Hepatic architecture is obscured by fibrous bands surrounding nodules of distorted liver cell plates. The fibrous bands contain proliferating bile ducts and inflammatory cells. In the final stages of cirrhosis the nodules become larger and more irregular resulting in a scarred, shrunken liver referred to as a \"hobnail liver\". Patients with cirrhosis of the liver often present with the following radiological findings. Fatty infiltration with hepatomegaly can be seen in the early stages of cirrhosis. Other characteristic findings include non-uniform attenuation due to chronic fatty infiltration and irregular fibrosis, irregular lobulated hepatic contour due to areas of atrophy and nodular regeneration, intrahepatic regenerating nodules, atrophy of the right lobe and hypertrophy of the left and caudate lobes, decreased liver volume accompanying chronic cirrhosis, increased size and prominence of the intrahepatic fissure due to shrunken liver parenchyma, signs of portal hypertension, and ascites. A ratio comparing the sizes of the caudate lobe and right lobe is a good diagnostic indicator of patients with cirrhosis. The caudate is measured transversely from the medial aspect of the caudate to the lateral aspect of the main portal vein. The right lobe is measured from this same point at the portal vein to the right lateral margin of the liver. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio greater than 0.65 provides 96% confidence in the diagnosis of cirrhosis. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio less then 0.6 makes cirrhosis unlikely, whereas a ratio of 0.37 is the average for normal livers.", "image_path": ["00132973.jpg"], "split": "train"}, {"id": "00133534.jpg", "report": "RADIOLOGY: HEPATOBILIARY:  GANGRENOUS CHOLECYSTITIS.

The patient is a 65 year old male with cirrhosis of the liver. This is a follow-up examination for a 1.2 cm lesion suspicious for hepatocellular carcinoma on a previous ultrasound examination.  There is a large amount of ascites. The liver has a cirrhotic configuration, however, no focal lesions are identified on this examination. Cholelithiasis is present. The spleen is mildly enlarged (measuring 14 cm in craniocaudad dimension), no focal lesions are present within the spleen. Otherwise, the pancreas, adrenals, kidneys, and urinary bladder are unremarkable in appearance. Prominent and thick mucosal folds are seen throughout the bowel. A left inguinal hernia is identified containing fluid, not bowel. No skeletal lesions are identified. The visualized portions of the lung bases demonstrate increased opacity over the posterior aspect of the right lower lobe consistent with atelectasis versus pneumonia. Incidental note is made of a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt catheter.  Liver cirrhosis is characterized by a generalized disorganization of hepatic archictecture with scarring and nodule formation. Other sequelae include liver cell damage, regenerative activity, and generalized fibrosis resulting in a nodular pattern. There is an increased incidence of hepatocelluar carcinoma associated with cirrhosis of the liver. Causes of cirrhosis include prolonged alcohol intake, viral hepatitis, biliary obstruction, Wilsons disease, and heart failure with long-standing chronic passive congestion of the liver. Alcoholic (Laennecs, nutritional) cirrhosis is the most frequently occurring form of the disorder. Clinical manifestations of the disease include jaundice, hypoalbuminemia, coagulation factor deficiencies, hyperstrinism, and intrahepatic scarring with increased portal venous pressure. The increase in portal venous pressure can lead to esophageal varices, rectal hemorrhiods, periumbilical venous collaterals (caput medusae), and splenomegaly. Morphologically, the liver may be enlarged or small and shrunken depending upon the progression of the disease. The nodular pattern is most often micronodular in alcoholic cirrhosis. Hepatic architecture is obscured by fibrous bands surrounding nodules of distorted liver cell plates. The fibrous bands contain proliferating bile ducts and inflammatory cells. In the final stages of cirrhosis the nodules become larger and more irregular resulting in a scarred, shrunken liver referred to as a \"hobnail liver\". Patients with cirrhosis of the liver often present with the following radiological findings. Fatty infiltration with hepatomegaly can be seen in the early stages of cirrhosis. Other characteristic findings include non-uniform attenuation due to chronic fatty infiltration and irregular fibrosis, irregular lobulated hepatic contour due to areas of atrophy and nodular regeneration, intrahepatic regenerating nodules, atrophy of the right lobe and hypertrophy of the left and caudate lobes, decreased liver volume accompanying chronic cirrhosis, increased size and prominence of the intrahepatic fissure due to shrunken liver parenchyma, signs of portal hypertension, and ascites. A ratio comparing the sizes of the caudate lobe and right lobe is a good diagnostic indicator of patients with cirrhosis. The caudate is measured transversely from the medial aspect of the caudate to the lateral aspect of the main portal vein. The right lobe is measured from this same point at the portal vein to the right lateral margin of the liver. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio greater than 0.65 provides 96% confidence in the diagnosis of cirrhosis. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio less then 0.6 makes cirrhosis unlikely, whereas a ratio of 0.37 is the average for normal livers.", "image_path": ["00133403.jpg"], "split": "val"}, {"id": "00133228.jpg", "report": "RADIOLOGY: HEPATOBILIARY:  HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA & CIRRHOSIS.  63 year old man with history of hepatitis C and cirrhosis.

Abrupt tapering of a dilated duct suggests a malignant process, such as pancreatic carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma, whereas gradual tapering is more commonly seen with an inflammatory process such as chronic pancreatitis. Gallstones are visualized as calcified or soft tissue density structures within the bile duct surrounded by lower density bile creating a target sign.

The gallbladder is markedly enlarged compared to a previous exam without cholelithiasis or gallbladder wall thickening. There is mild intrahepatic duct dilatation but marked dilatation of the common bile duct to a diameter of 2.0 cm. The pancreatic duct is only slightly dilated. A focal mass is present within the pancreatic head measuring 3.3 cm x 3.8 cm. The mass is notably larger than the pancreatic body and has enlarged since previous scan. There is no associated adenopathy. Past Exam:There is mild diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver. No other focal hepatic or splenic lesions are seen. The pancreas, adrenals, kidneys, ureters and bladder are unremarkable. No free intraperitoneal fluid or adenopathy is seen.  This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass;however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs or the SMA, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

Although the adipocytes are histologically similar to normal fat cells they are not available for normal fat metabolism. Radiographic methods are effective for diagnosing both subcutaneous and deep lipomas. On CT and MR lipomas are characterized as being homogeneous and similar in attenuation or signal intensity to subcutaneous fat. Structures adjacent to lipomas are usually displaced or compressed, but rarely infiltrated. Although typical lipomas do not exhibit neovascularity, early venous filling, or hypervascularity on angiograms, there are certain variants that do display these phenomena.

The mass abuts the right lateral surface of the superior mesenteric vein, but there is apparent preservation of a separating fat plane. The superior mesenteric artery, portal vein, and IVC are patent and show no evidence of encasement. A single 12 mm lymph node is identified within the porta. No other retroperitoneal adenopathy is seen. In the lateral segment of the left hepatic lobe is a 7mm hypodense lesion which is suspicious for metastatic disease. An ill defined low density lesion may also be present in the posterior segment of the right hepatic lobe. The gastrohepatic ligament is free of adenopathy.  This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass;however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

There is descending colonic and sigmoid diverticulosis.  Colorectal adenocarcinoma is one of the most common neoplasms encountered in the affluent countries of the Western world. The disease exhibits a peak age incidence in the sixth and seventh decades. It is associated with increased serum concentration of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Predisposing factors for colorectal cancer include adenomatous polyps, inherited multiple polyposis syndromes, long-standing ulcerative colitis, close relatives with colon cancer, and a low fiber, high animal fat diet. Colorectal cancer varies in gross presentation according to the region of the colon involved. Carcinoma of the rectosigmoid colon usually presents in an annular manner, often producing early bowel obstruction. Carcinoma of the right colon, however, usually does not obstruct early and frequently presents with iron deficiency anemia secondary to chronic blood loss. Colon cancer spreads by direct extension due to penetration of the colon wall, lymphatic drainage to regional nodes, through the portal system to the liver, and intraperitoneal seeding. Although barium enemas and colonoscopy are the primary methods used to initially diagnose colorectal cancer, CT is an excellent procedure for the detection of recurrence.

A focal mass is present within the pancreatic head measuring 3.3 cm x 3.8 cm. The mass is notably larger than the pancreatic body and has enlarged since previous scan.

The primary finding on CT is a focal mass;however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs or the SMA, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs or the SMA, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

The ascending aorta and aortic arch appear normal. There is aortic dissection in the descending thoracic aorta beginning immediately distal to the arch and extending into the proximal abdominal aorta. The true lumen is compressed and false lumen is significantly thrombosed.  CT has to a large degree replaced arteriography in diagnosing aortic dissection and determining its type and location. The diagnosis is made by the demonstration of an intimal flap, displaced inward from the edge of the aorta and lying between the true and false channels. In Dailys classification, types A and B are described with type A being more common. Type A involves the ascending aorta and is usually treated surgically because of the potential for retrograde dissection. Type B involves the area distal to the left subclavian artery and is treated medically. CT is used for screening those with suspected aortic dissection and for follow-up of patients previously diagnosed with dissection. It should be performed with bolus contrast enhancement and dynamic scanning at three levels: (1) the aortic arch; (2) the proximal aortic root and descending aorta near the level of the pulmonary artery; (3) the more distal descending thoracic aorta. Newer helical CT scanners allow rapid scanning of the arch during bolus contrast injection eliminating the need for the \"three level scan\". Two passes can be made throught the aortic arch early in the contrast injection. In a patient with dissection, the intimal flap may be delineated by contrast filling both the true and false channels. One of the channels may fill slowly, thus requiring the use of images late in the sequence to make the diagnosis. A false channel that contains a clot may not opacify and in such a case, may be difficult to distinguish from a clot-filled atherosclerotic aneurysm. Dissections, however, are usually longer than clot-filled aneurysms and may produce an abrupt change in aortic caliber and thickening of the aortic wall. Streak artifacts due to wall motion or vascular pulsations may mimic an intimal flap. Streak artifacts are usually seen in the descending aorta adjacent to the left heart.

Patient is a 30 year old female with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). She has known marked hepatosplenomegaly and has had prior splenic infarctions.  There is moderately severe hepatomegaly without evidence of focal lesion or biliary dilatation. The spleen is massively enlarged measuring 25cm in cranio-caudal dimension. There is an irregular area of mixed predominantly low attenuation involving large wedge of tissue anteriorly and also extending upward toward the lateral upper splenic margin. Previously identified infarction in the lateral lower pole has resolved leaving a small scar. There is a trace of pelvic fluid.  Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), also referred to as chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL), is a neoplastic clonal proliferation of myeloid stem cells. CML is characterized on a molecular level by a reciprocal chromosomal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, resulting in the formation of the Philadelphia chromosome. Other characteristics of CML include marked leukocytosis, with white cell counts varying from 50,000 to 200,000/?L; leukemic cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow, mainly middle- to-late myeloid (granulocytic) precursor cells, including myelocytes, metamyelocytes, bands, and segmented forms; small numbers of blasts and promyelocytes; the Philadelphia chromosome, found in granulocytic and erythroid precursor cells and megakaryocytes; marked reduction in leukocyte alkaline phosphatase activity in the leukemic leukocyte. CML presents clinically with prominent splenomegaly and modestly enlarged liver and lymph nodes. The peak incidence of the disease is in the middle-age population (ages 35-50). In most cases the disease terminates in an accelerated phase known as a \"blastic crisis\" which is signaled by an increasing number of blast cells and promyelocytes. CT findings of CML include splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and enlarged lymph nodes. Splenomegaly is defined as spleen size greater than 12 cm in the long axis and extension below the costal margin or substantially below the upper pole of the left kidney. Splenic infarction, a finding also asscoiated with CML, classically appers as a wedge-shaped hypodense area. However, the wedge shape is often obscured by the fusion of multiple infarcts of various sizes. The key finding is extension of the low density area to the capsule of the spleen without causing mass effect. The infarcted areas progressively atrophy, eventually resulting in notching of the splenic contour and occasionally in calcification. Other causes of splenic infarction include sickle cell and cardiac disease, lymphoma, and metastases.

A 53 year-old Black female who complained of a sensation of something \"dropping\" in her pelvis several months prior to imaging as well as dysuria that resolved with oral antibiotics several weeks ago. Cystoscopy done just prior to radiologic evaluation was unremarkable.  Two large radiopaque stones projecting over the lower pubic symphysis on scout film. VCUG demonstrated a posterior urethral diverticulum which contained both sontes within it. Bladder was normal. The diverticulum opening was located near the bladder neck.  The female urethra, which is homologous to the posterior urethra in the male minus the verumontanum, is approximately 4 cm long. It courses obliquely downward from the internal urethral opening and is slightly curved, although its course is normally quite variable. The urethra contains periuurethral glands (throughout its length?), and glands similar to the male prostatic glands are often also present. Most female diverticula are acquired rather than congenital and occur posteriorly in the midurethra. They are thought to result from infected periurethral glands that form abscess cavities that then rupture into the urethral lumen. Other possible causes of acquired diverticula include trauma during childbirth, instrumenation and fulguration of urethral lesions, urethral strictures or stones. Both benign and malignant tumors arising within the diverticulum itself have also been described in case reports. Acquired diverticula are thought to be present in up to 3% of asymptomatic females. Complications can include stone formation, dysuria, frequent urinary tract infections and dyspareunia, as well as post-void dribbling. Physical exam is usually normal although a palpable, bulging mass is occasionally present and this was the case with the patient presented here in whom one of her diverticular stones had actually begun to erode through the diverticular wall which was clearly visible at her introitus. Other than location, the differentiation between congenital versus acqured diverticula can be very difficult. Congenital diverticula usually occur in the anterior urethra and are almost exclusively a male phenomenon. The appearance of urethral diverticula can be quite variable dependingon the location and the patients sex as well. They can be multiple, or multilocular, saccular, tubular or ovoid and can have a variable number of openings into the urethral lumen. In females, the diverticulum is usually short-necked and tubular or oval. Cystoscopy is not very sensitive, missing up to 60% of cases.

Increased density or inhomogeneity indicate some complicating factor such as hemorrhage or infection. Psuedocysts may also form in the walls of bowel (stomach, duodenum, colon) due to extension of pancreatic enzymes into the surrounding tissues.", "image_path": ["00133609.jpg"], "split": "val"}, {"id": "00136393.jpg", "report": "RADIOLOGY: VASCULAR:  PTE.  84 year old male in motor vehicle accident.", "image_path": ["00136393.jpg"], "split": "val"}, {"id": "00136116.jpg", "report": "RADIOLOGY: GASTROINTESTINAL: GI:  MILD APPENDICITIS WITHOUT EVIDENCE OF PERFORATION", "image_path": ["00136116.jpg"], "split": "val"}, {"id": "00132860.jpg", "report": "RADIOLOGY: HEPATOBILIARY:  FNH.

Management of asymptomatic lesions is controversial although elective surgical resection is usually performed. Observation may be warranted if surgery would be hazardous or difficult. The typical imaging of FNH is a hypodense homogeneous mass on unenhanced CT scan and a hyperdense or isodense mass on enhanced CT.

It is better visualized on todays examination and shows some areas of enhancement. The left adrenal gland is slightly prominent, but its adeniform contour is preserved. The renal vein is prominent but appears patent as do the other major vessels in the upper abdomen.  85% of renal neoplasms are renal cell carcinomas. They most commonly occur in men, at ages 50-70, and are usually unilateral. Only 2% are bilateral. Metastases are present at the time of diagnosis in 40% of cases. Since surgery is the only cure, early detection and accurate staging are important. Contrast-enhanced CT detects 96% of renal cell carcinomas. When IV contrast administration is contraindicated, MR is the preferred method of evaluation. The most common CT finding is a solid mass although low density areas due to hemorrhage or necrosis may be present. Strongly enhancing tumors are lower in density than renal parenchyma. Cystic and multicystic forms may be seen. Stippled central or \"eggshell\" peripheral calcifications are seen in 10%.

A more well defined fluid collection in continuity with the second and third segment of the duodenum suggests that fluid may have dissected within the serosa of the second and third duodenal segments. There are strands of high attenuation within this fluid collection on the pre-contrast study, suggesting hemorrhage. There is moderate gaseous and fluid distention of the stomach suggesting at least partial obstruction at the duodenum. A moderate left pleural effusion with associated left lower lobe atelectasis is present. The liver is diffusely diminished in attenuation without evidence of focal lesion. Strandy opacities are present throughout the mesentery consistent with congestion and/or inflammation. A small amount of ascites is seen within the pelvis. Incidental note is made of a left simple renal cyst and gunshot fragments within the left paraspinal tissues.  Pancreatitis is thought to result from inappropriate intrapancreatic activation of proteases, causing autodigestion of the gland and leading to pancreatic inflammatory disease. The two most common causes of acute pancreatitis are ethanol abuse and choledocholithiasis. Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is made on the basis of the history, physical findings, and an elevation in the serum amylase. Since, however, serum amylase may be normal in 1/3 of patients having alcoholic pancreatitis, CT may be needed to confirm the diagnosis. CT findings include diffuse or focal glandular enlargement, contour irregularity, focal irregular areas of decreased attenuation secondary to necrosis or edema, and changes in the peripancreatic areolar tissues, fat, and parietal peritoneal planes. Hemorrhagic pancreatitis is an important manifestation of acute pancreatitis that may lead to hypovolemic shock and death. This may appear on CT as pancreatic and peripancreatic fluid collections with areas of high density, indicative of blood clots within the bed of the pancreas. These fluid collections may mimic pseudocysts, however, fluid collections due to hemorrhagic pancreatitis differ in that they change in size, shape, and location while pseudocysts tend to be more permanent. Typical CT findings of pseudocysts show low-density fluid masses with well-defined walls of variable thickness. Calcifications may occur within the pseudocysts. Intramural pseudocysts in the stomach, duodenum, and colon are relatively rare but do occur. These most commonly involve the posterolateral wall of the second part of the duodenum and may produce obstruction of the the bowel lumen.

There are multiple linear areas of low attenuation in the spleen consistent with splenic laceration and contusion. There is free fluid around the spleen as well. Fluid is noted in both pericolic gutters and the cul-de-sac consistent with hemorrhage.

Pancreatic trauma is uncommon and associated with a high mortality since it is often occult. It is usually the result of blunt trauma, particularly child abuse. Trauma to the pancreas may cause pancreatitis, lacerations, and transections. Complete transection may be diagnosed by CT which will generally show two ends of the pancreas separated by low-density fluid that remains relatively confined to the anterior pararenal space in the immediate post-injury period. Pancreatic enlargement may also be evident. A feature common to most hepatic injury is intrahepatic hemorrhage. Hemorrhage often has a layered appearance caused by successive bleeding and clotting. Hemoperitoneum may occur in injuries extending through the capsule with bleeding or bile leakage. Other causes of intraperitoneal fluid, urine and ascites, are possible. High density fluid, however, suggests recent bleeding. Lacerations or fractures may be stellate or linear. They are defined on CT by hematoma within the area of injury.

The patient is a 65 year old male with cirrhosis of the liver. This is a follow-up examination for a 1.2 cm lesion suspicious for hepatocellular carcinoma on a previous ultrasound examination.  There is a large amount of ascites. The liver has a cirrhotic configuration, however, no focal lesions are identified on this examination. Cholelithiasis is present. The spleen is mildly enlarged (measuring 14 cm in craniocaudad dimension), no focal lesions are present within the spleen. Otherwise, the pancreas, adrenals, kidneys, and urinary bladder are unremarkable in appearance. Prominent and thick mucosal folds are seen throughout the bowel. A left inguinal hernia is identified containing fluid, not bowel. No skeletal lesions are identified. The visualized portions of the lung bases demonstrate increased opacity over the posterior aspect of the right lower lobe consistent with atelectasis versus pneumonia. Incidental note is made of a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt catheter.  Liver cirrhosis is characterized by a generalized disorganization of hepatic archictecture with scarring and nodule formation. Other sequelae include liver cell damage, regenerative activity, and generalized fibrosis resulting in a nodular pattern. There is an increased incidence of hepatocelluar carcinoma associated with cirrhosis of the liver. Causes of cirrhosis include prolonged alcohol intake, viral hepatitis, biliary obstruction, Wilsons disease, and heart failure with long-standing chronic passive congestion of the liver. Alcoholic (Laennecs, nutritional) cirrhosis is the most frequently occurring form of the disorder. Clinical manifestations of the disease include jaundice, hypoalbuminemia, coagulation factor deficiencies, hyperstrinism, and intrahepatic scarring with increased portal venous pressure. The increase in portal venous pressure can lead to esophageal varices, rectal hemorrhiods, periumbilical venous collaterals (caput medusae), and splenomegaly. Morphologically, the liver may be enlarged or small and shrunken depending upon the progression of the disease. The nodular pattern is most often micronodular in alcoholic cirrhosis. Hepatic architecture is obscured by fibrous bands surrounding nodules of distorted liver cell plates. The fibrous bands contain proliferating bile ducts and inflammatory cells. In the final stages of cirrhosis the nodules become larger and more irregular resulting in a scarred, shrunken liver referred to as a \"hobnail liver\". Patients with cirrhosis of the liver often present with the following radiological findings. Fatty infiltration with hepatomegaly can be seen in the early stages of cirrhosis. Other characteristic findings include non-uniform attenuation due to chronic fatty infiltration and irregular fibrosis, irregular lobulated hepatic contour due to areas of atrophy and nodular regeneration, intrahepatic regenerating nodules, atrophy of the right lobe and hypertrophy of the left and caudate lobes, decreased liver volume accompanying chronic cirrhosis, increased size and prominence of the intrahepatic fissure due to shrunken liver parenchyma, signs of portal hypertension, and ascites. A ratio comparing the sizes of the caudate lobe and right lobe is a good diagnostic indicator of patients with cirrhosis. The caudate is measured transversely from the medial aspect of the caudate to the lateral aspect of the main portal vein. The right lobe is measured from this same point at the portal vein to the right lateral margin of the liver. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio greater than 0.65 provides 96% confidence in the diagnosis of cirrhosis. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio less then 0.6 makes cirrhosis unlikely, whereas a ratio of 0.37 is the average for normal livers.", "image_path": ["00133402.jpg"], "split": "val"}, {"id": "00136622.jpg", "report": "RADIOLOGY: ABDOMEN: Patient is a 28 year-old female with known metastatic malignant melanoma.

A colonoscopy performed 8/6/95, revealed a mass in the proximal descending colon, and an intraluminal stent was placed. The patient also complains of left hip pain.  A mesh-stent is noted in the descending colon with a thickened bowel wall surrounding it. A large mass is noted with necrotic/cystic areas, measuring 6.5 x 8.0 x 10.0 cm, extending from the lower pole of the left kidney. This mass appears to be impinging on the descending colon. The descending colon surrounding the stent appears thickened and inflamed. A soft tissue mass is noted surrounding the left inferior pubic ramus, the left acetabulum, and the left iliac bone with bony destruction noted. The femoral head and neck appear surrounded by the mass but do not exhibit any bony destruction. A small pleural effusion is noted to the right lung base. The liver appears free of lesions. A 2.0 cm area of low attenuation is noted to the left kidney, consistent with renal cyst. Atherosclerotic calcific changes are noted to the descending aorta and common iliac arteries. The pancreas is normal. The adrenals are normal. No lymphadenopathy is noted.  Colorectal adenocarcinoma is one of the most common neoplasms encountered in the affluent countries of the Western world. The disease exhibits a peak age incidence in the sixth and seventh decades. It is associated with increased serum concentration of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Predisposing factors for colorectal cancer include adenomatous polyps, inherited multiple polyposis syndromes, long-standing ulcerative colitis, close relatives with colon cancer, and a low fiber, high animal fat diet. Colorectal cancer varies in gross presentation according to the region of the colon involved. Carcinoma of the rectosigmoid colon usually presents in an annular manner, often producing early bowel obstruction. Carcinoma of the right colon, however, usually does not obstruct early and frequently presents with iron deficiency anemia secondary to chronic blood loss. Colon cancer spreads by direct extension due to penetration of the colon wall, lymphatic drainage to regional nodes, through the portal system to the liver, and intraperitoneal seeding. Although barium enemas and colonoscopy are the primary methods used to initially diagnose colorectal cancer, CT is an excellent procedure for the detection of recurrence. CT findings of colon cancer include focal lobulated soft tissue mass in the colon, localized thickening of greater than 5 mm of the bowel wall, irregular lumen surface, extension of linear soft tissue densities or discrete mass into pericolic fat or adjacent organs, regional adenopathy, and liver metastases. Soft tissue masses visualized within the peritoneal cavity may signify metastases or recurrence of the cancer. Calcification in the primary tumor can be seen with mucinous adenocarcinoma. 85% of renal neoplasms are renal cell carcinomas, most commonly occurring in men, at ages 50-70, and usually involving one kidney. Only 2% are bilateral. Metastases are present at the time of diagnosis in 40% of cases. Since surgery is the only cure, early detection and accurate staging are important. The most common CT finding is a solid mass although low density areas due to hemorrhage or necrosis may be present. Cystic and multicystic forms may be seen. Stippled central or \"eggshell\" peripheral calcifications are seen in 10%. These tumors are usually hypervascular which may be evidenced by the presence of tortuous vessels in the perirenal fat. Tumor growth into the renal vein occurs in 30% of the time and into the inferior vena cava 5-10%. Venous invasion does not preclude surgical resection, but its identification is crucial to surgical planning. Renal cell carcinomas may spread locally to perirenal fat and adjacent organs. This is seen as strand or nodules of low density. Enlargement of renal hilar, pericaval, and periaortic nodes to 15mm or more indicates lymphatic spread. Hematogenous spread to the lung, bone, liver, adrenals, and the opposite kidney may occur. Distant metastases occasionally disappear with the removal of the primary tumor.

It is better visualized on todays examination and shows some areas of enhancement. The left adrenal gland is slightly prominent, but its adeniform contour is preserved. The renal vein is prominent but appears patent as do the other major vessels in the upper abdomen.  85% of renal neoplasms are renal cell carcinomas. They most commonly occur in men, at ages 50-70, and are usually unilateral. Only 2% are bilateral. Metastases are present at the time of diagnosis in 40% of cases. Since surgery is the only cure, early detection and accurate staging are important. Contrast-enhanced CT detects 96% of renal cell carcinomas. When IV contrast administration is contraindicated, MR is the preferred method of evaluation. The most common CT finding is a solid mass although low density areas due to hemorrhage or necrosis may be present. Strongly enhancing tumors are lower in density than renal parenchyma. Cystic and multicystic forms may be seen. Stippled central or \"eggshell\" peripheral calcifications are seen in 10%. These tumors are usually hypervascular which may be evidenced by the presence of tortuous vessels in the perirenal fat. Tumor growth into the renal vein occurs in 30% of the time and into the inferior vena cava 5-10%. Venous invasion does not preclude surgical resection, but its identification is crucial to surgical planning. CT typically shows enlarged, poorly enhancing veins which are filled with tumor thrombus seen as nodular low density within the vein. This may extend into the inferior vena cava all the way up to the right atrium. Renal cell carcinomas may spread locally to perirenal fat and adjacent organs. This is seen as strand or nodules of low density. Enlargement of renal hilar, pericaval, and periaortic nodes to 15mm or more indicates lymphatic spread.

Patient is a 17 y.o. young man with a history of complex partial seizures.  Selected axial and coronal images from an interictal18-FDG PET study reveal hypometabolism of the left anterior temporal lobe. MRI T2 weighted image through the temporal lobes reveals an area of increased signal intensity in the left hippocampus.  18-FDG is a glucose analoge that competes with glucose for uptake. Once it is actively transported, it is then phosphorylated but not further metabolized. Consequently its accumulation within a cell is a function of the cells metabolic rate. Preoperative planning for epilepsy surgery often includes an interictal PET study to localize the epilepsy site. Focal hypometabolism relative to the contralateral structures suggests a seizure focus. PET will demonstrate interictal temporal lobe hypometabolism in 70% of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (1). Proper interpretation requires knowledge of any seizure activity that may have occurred during the uptake of the 18-FDG, in which case a hypermetabolic focus may be seen. Another approach to localization of seizure foci has been ictal Tc-99m HMPAO (or ECD) brain SPECT. This also has a sensitivity of 70% of depicting epileptic foci but requires rapid administration of a radiopharmaceutical immediately upon seizure activity (1). An interictal SPECT study is usually obtained as a baseline study for comparison with the ictal scan. Also, the interictal SPECT study has a 55% incidence of showing hypoperfusion at the epilepsy site (2). Patient Prep: The patients EEG was monitored shortly before, during uptake, and during imaging. Since ingested glucose could compete with the 18-2 flouro-2 deoxyglucose(18-FDG), the patient should be NPO 4 hours prior to injection.

Radiolucent stones, such as uric acid, xanthine and cystine stones, have a higher attenuation than urine, renal parenchyma and blood clots on CT and thus can be differentiated from other causes of filling defects such a tumor or hematoma. The diagnosis of obstruction and hydronephrosis may be made with or without the use of contrast. It may be easier, however, to distinguish parenchyma from dilated calices with contrast. Extra-renal pelves, dilated calices secondary to post-obtructive atrophy, and parapelvic cysts may mimic changes due to hydronephrosis.

Ascites has further increased.  Colorectal adenocarcinoma is one of the most common neoplasms encountered in the affluent countries of the Western world. The disease exhibits a peak age incidence in the sixth and seventh decades. It is associated with increased serum concentration of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Predisposing factors for colorectal cancer include adenomatous polyps, inherited multiple polyposis syndromes, long-standing ulcerative colitis, close relatives with colon cancer, and a low fiber, high animal fat diet. Colorectal cancer varies in gross presentation according to the region of the colon involved. Carcinoma of the rectosigmoid colon usually presents in an annular manner, often producing early bowel obstruction. Carcinoma of the right colon, however, usually does not obstruct early and frequently presents with iron deficiency anemia secondary to chronic blood loss. Colon cancer spreads by direct extension due to penetration of the colon wall, lymphatic drainage to regional nodes, through the portal system to the liver, and intraperitoneal seeding. Although barium enemas and colonoscopy are the primary methods used to initially diagnose colorectal cancer, CT is an excellent procedure for the detection of recurrence. CT findings of colon cancer include focal lobulated soft tissue mass in the colon, localized thickening of greater than 5 mm of the bowel wall, irregular lumen surface, extension of linear soft tissue densities or discrete mass into pericolic fat or adjacent organs, regional adenopathy, and liver metastases.

There is complete situs inversus. The liver is only mildly cirrhotic in configuration with slight prominence of the caudate and left hepatic lobes. No focal hepatic lesions are seen. The spleen is moderately enlarged. There is extensive diverticulosis of the colon.  Normal anatomical positioning is termed situs solitus. The cardiac apex, aortic arch, and stomach are all normally on the left. In addition, the anatomic left atrium is on the same side as the hyparterial bronchus and bilobed lung; the anatomic right atrium is on the same side as the eparterial bronchus and trilobed lung. With normal situs and levocardia, the incidence of congenital heart disease is less than 1%; with dextrocardia, the incidence rises to 95%. As shown above, situs inversus is a mirror image of normal anatomy. In situs inversus totalis, the cardiac apex, stomach and aortic arch are all on the right. Situs inversus totalis is associated with a 5-10% incidence of congenital heart disease. Situs inversus with levocardia (right-sided stomach and left-sided heart) is associated with congenital heart disease in 95% of cases, but is very rare. Kartageners syndrome may also be seen in connection with situs inversus. Kartageners syndrome represents a triad of situs inversus (seen in 50% of cases), sinusitis, and bronchiectasis. The latter two parts of the triad are due to immotile or dysmotile cilia affecting the respiratory epithelium, auditory epithelium, and the sperm in males; therefore, hearing difficulties and infertility may also be found in this syndrome.

Although common bile duct stones may form de novo in the biliary tree, most come from the gallbladder. CT is about 95% accurate in diagnosing biliary obstruction. CT diagnosis is based on the findings of dilated intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts. This dilatation may be absent in cirrhosis, cholangitis, or periductal fibrosis, thereby creating a false-negative. Dilated intrahepatic ducts will appear as branching tubular or round structures of low density enlarging as they approach the porta hepatis. Dilatation of the common bile duct to greater than 7mm in diameter also indicates obstruction. CT is also useful in differentiating causes of obstruction. Abrupt tapering of a dilated duct suggests a malignant process, such as pancreatic carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma, whereas gradual tapering is more commonly seen with an inflammatory process such as chronic pancreatitis. Gallstones are visualized as calcified or soft tissue density structures within the bile duct surrounded by lower density bile creating a target sign.

There is no evidence of intestinal obstruction or free air evident.  Colorectal adenocarcinoma is one of the most common neoplasms encountered in the affluent countries of the Western world. The disease exhibits a peak age incidence in the sixth and seventh decades. It is associated with increased serum concentration of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Predisposing factors for colorectal cancer include adenomatous polyps, inherited multiple polyposis syndromes, long-standing ulcerative colitis, close relatives with colon cancer, and a low fiber, high animal fat diet. Colorectal cancer varies in gross presentation according to the region of the colon involved. Carcinoma of the rectosigmoid colon usually presents in an annular manner, often producing early bowel obstruction. Carcinoma of the right colon, however, usually does not obstruct early and frequently presents with iron deficiency anemia secondary to chronic blood loss. Colon cancer spreads by direct extension due to penetration of the colon wall, lymphatic drainage to regional nodes, through the portal system to the liver, and intraperitoneal seeding. Although barium enemas and colonoscopy are the primary methods used to initially diagnose colorectal cancer, CT is an excellent procedure for the detection of recurrence.

A 53 year-old Black female who complained of a sensation of something \"dropping\" in her pelvis several months prior to imaging as well as dysuria that resolved with oral antibiotics several weeks ago. Cystoscopy done just prior to radiologic evaluation was unremarkable.  Two large radiopaque stones projecting over the lower pubic symphysis on scout film. VCUG demonstrated a posterior urethral diverticulum which contained both sontes within it. Bladder was normal. The diverticulum opening was located near the bladder neck.  The female urethra, which is homologous to the posterior urethra in the male minus the verumontanum, is approximately 4 cm long. It courses obliquely downward from the internal urethral opening and is slightly curved, although its course is normally quite variable. The urethra contains periuurethral glands (throughout its length?), and glands similar to the male prostatic glands are often also present. Most female diverticula are acquired rather than congenital and occur posteriorly in the midurethra. They are thought to result from infected periurethral glands that form abscess cavities that then rupture into the urethral lumen. Other possible causes of acquired diverticula include trauma during childbirth, instrumenation and fulguration of urethral lesions, urethral strictures or stones. Both benign and malignant tumors arising within the diverticulum itself have also been described in case reports. Acquired diverticula are thought to be present in up to 3% of asymptomatic females. Complications can include stone formation, dysuria, frequent urinary tract infections and dyspareunia, as well as post-void dribbling. Physical exam is usually normal although a palpable, bulging mass is occasionally present and this was the case with the patient presented here in whom one of her diverticular stones had actually begun to erode through the diverticular wall which was clearly visible at her introitus. Other than location, the differentiation between congenital versus acqured diverticula can be very difficult. Congenital diverticula usually occur in the anterior urethra and are almost exclusively a male phenomenon. The appearance of urethral diverticula can be quite variable dependingon the location and the patients sex as well. They can be multiple, or multilocular, saccular, tubular or ovoid and can have a variable number of openings into the urethral lumen. In females, the diverticulum is usually short-necked and tubular or oval. Cystoscopy is not very sensitive, missing up to 60% of cases.

Ultrasound performed earlier today showed mass lesions in the region of the pancreatic head and ascites.  There are multiple low attenuation lesions present throughout both the left and right lobe of the liver, most measuring 1 cm or less. There are multiple low attenuation lobular lesions extending superiorly from the neck and body of the pancreas. The head of the pancreas appears relatively spared. There is mild dilatation of the pancreatic duct within the body and tail of the pancreas, with atrophy of the tail of the pancreas. There is thickening of the omentum anterior to the liver. There is retrocrural, aortocaval, para-aortic, and portocaval adenopathy present. There are soft tissue implants adjacent to the medial aspect of the spleen. There are clips in the gallbladder bed consistent with previous cholecystectomy. The left adrenal gland appears thickened.  This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass;however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs or the SMA, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

The ascending aorta and aortic arch appear normal. There is aortic dissection in the descending thoracic aorta beginning immediately distal to the arch and extending into the proximal abdominal aorta. The true lumen is compressed and false lumen is significantly thrombosed.  CT has to a large degree replaced arteriography in diagnosing aortic dissection and determining its type and location. The diagnosis is made by the demonstration of an intimal flap, displaced inward from the edge of the aorta and lying between the true and false channels. In Dailys classification, types A and B are described with type A being more common. Type A involves the ascending aorta and is usually treated surgically because of the potential for retrograde dissection. Type B involves the area distal to the left subclavian artery and is treated medically. CT is used for screening those with suspected aortic dissection and for follow-up of patients previously diagnosed with dissection. It should be performed with bolus contrast enhancement and dynamic scanning at three levels: (1) the aortic arch; (2) the proximal aortic root and descending aorta near the level of the pulmonary artery; (3) the more distal descending thoracic aorta. Newer helical CT scanners allow rapid scanning of the arch during bolus contrast injection eliminating the need for the \"three level scan\". Two passes can be made throught the aortic arch early in the contrast injection. In a patient with dissection, the intimal flap may be delineated by contrast filling both the true and false channels. One of the channels may fill slowly, thus requiring the use of images late in the sequence to make the diagnosis. A false channel that contains a clot may not opacify and in such a case, may be difficult to distinguish from a clot-filled atherosclerotic aneurysm. Dissections, however, are usually longer than clot-filled aneurysms and may produce an abrupt change in aortic caliber and thickening of the aortic wall. Streak artifacts due to wall motion or vascular pulsations may mimic an intimal flap. Streak artifacts are usually seen in the descending aorta adjacent to the left heart. They are usually less well-defined than a true intimal flap, extending beyond the edge of the aorta and inconsistently seen from level to level.

Patient is a 17 y.o. young man with a history of complex partial seizures.  Selected axial and coronal images from an interictal18-FDG PET study reveal hypometabolism of the left anterior temporal lobe. MRI T2 weighted image through the temporal lobes reveals an area of increased signal intensity in the left hippocampus.  18-FDG is a glucose analoge that competes with glucose for uptake. Once it is actively transported, it is then phosphorylated but not further metabolized. Consequently its accumulation within a cell is a function of the cells metabolic rate. Preoperative planning for epilepsy surgery often includes an interictal PET study to localize the epilepsy site. Focal hypometabolism relative to the contralateral structures suggests a seizure focus. PET will demonstrate interictal temporal lobe hypometabolism in 70% of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (1). Proper interpretation requires knowledge of any seizure activity that may have occurred during the uptake of the 18-FDG, in which case a hypermetabolic focus may be seen. Another approach to localization of seizure foci has been ictal Tc-99m HMPAO (or ECD) brain SPECT. This also has a sensitivity of 70% of depicting epileptic foci but requires rapid administration of a radiopharmaceutical immediately upon seizure activity (1). An interictal SPECT study is usually obtained as a baseline study for comparison with the ictal scan. Also, the interictal SPECT study has a 55% incidence of showing hypoperfusion at the epilepsy site (2). Patient Prep: The patients EEG was monitored shortly before, during uptake, and during imaging. Since ingested glucose could compete with the 18-2 flouro-2 deoxyglucose(18-FDG), the patient should be NPO 4 hours prior to injection.

This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass;however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass.

Predisposing factors for colorectal cancer include adenomatous polyps, inherited multiple polyposis syndromes, long-standing ulcerative colitis, close relatives with colon cancer, and a low fiber, high animal fat diet. Colorectal cancer varies in gross presentation according to the region of the colon involved. Carcinoma of the rectosigmoid colon usually presents in an annular manner, often producing early bowel obstruction.

Colon cancer spreads by direct extension due to penetration of the colon wall, lymphatic drainage to regional nodes, through the portal system to the liver, and intraperitoneal seeding.

The patient has a history of distal pancreatectomy secondary to pseudocyst formation.  There is a 3.4 x 5.0 cm mass within the head of the pancreas. Within this mass there are some cystic areas with calcifications. This mass protrudes into the lumen of the duodenum near the junction of the second and third portions. There are multiple adjacent lymph nodes. There is a 1.2 x 2.2 cm node anterior to the head of the pancreas along the greater curve of the stomach. Also, there is a 1 x 1 cm aortocaval node posterior to the head of the pancreas. There are multiple other smaller lymph nodes anterior and inferior to the pancreas. There has been a distal pancreatectomy (history of pseudocyst in the past).  This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass;however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs or the SMA, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

The patient is a 59 year old black male with alcoholic cirrhosis and known hepatocellular carcinoma.  The study is compared with prior CT exam. The liver again has a cirrhotic configuration and there is now an 8 x 12 cm heterogeneous mass present in the medial segment of the left hepatic lobe. A smaller, 2 x 3 cm, hypodense lesion is also noted to be present in the posterior aspect of the lateral segment of the left hepatic lobe. Portal vein occlusion is present with cavernous transformation. Splenomegaly is again noted with a large number of splenorenal, splenogastric and esophageal varices. The enlarged spleen and varices displace the left kidney as on previous exam. The gallbladder wall is edematous without evidence of pericholecystic fluid.  Liver cirrhosis is characterized by a generalized disorganization of hepatic archictecture with scarring and nodule formation. Other sequelae include liver cell damage, regenerative activity, and generalized fibrosis resulting in a nodular pattern. There is an increased incidence of hepatocelluar carcinoma associated with cirrhosis of the liver. Causes of cirrhosis include prolonged alcohol intake, viral hepatitis, biliary obstruction, Wilsons disease, and heart failure with long-standing chronic passive congestion of the liver. Alcoholic (Laennecs, nutritional) cirrhosis is the most frequently occurring form of the disorder. Clinical manifestations of the disease include jaundice, hypoalbuminemia, coagulation factor deficiencies, hyperstrinism, and intrahepatic scarring with increased portal venous pressure. The increase in portal venous pressure can lead to esophageal varices, rectal hemorrhiods, periumbilical venous collaterals (caput medusae), and splenomegaly. Morphologically, the liver may be enlarged or small and shrunken depending upon the progression of the disease. The nodular pattern is most often micronodular in alcoholic cirrhosis. Hepatic architecture is obscured by fibrous bands surrounding nodules of distorted liver cell plates. The fibrous bands contain proliferating bile ducts and inflammatory cells. In the final stages of cirrhosis the nodules become larger and more irregular resulting in a scarred, shrunken liver referred to as a \"hobnail liver\". Patients with cirrhosis of the liver often present with the following radiological findings. Fatty infiltration with hepatomegaly can be seen in the early stages of cirrhosis. Other characteristic findings include non-uniform attenuation due to chronic fatty infiltration and irregular fibrosis, irregular lobulated hepatic contour due to areas of atrophy and nodular regeneration, intrahepatic regenerating nodules, atrophy of the right lobe and hypertrophy of the left and caudate lobes, decreased liver volume accompanying chronic cirrhosis, increased size and prominence of the intrahepatic fissure due to shrunken liver parenchyma, signs of portal hypertension, and ascites. A ratio comparing the sizes of the caudate lobe and right lobe is a good diagnostic indicator of patients with cirrhosis. The caudate is measured transversely from the medial aspect of the caudate to the lateral aspect of the main portal vein. The right lobe is measured from this same point at the portal vein to the right lateral margin of the liver. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio greater than 0.65 provides 96% confidence in the diagnosis of cirrhosis. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio less then 0.6 makes cirrhosis unlikely, whereas a ratio of 0.37 is the average for normal livers.", "image_path": ["00133515.jpg"], "split": "val"}, {"id": "00134531.jpg", "report": "RADIOLOGY: HEPATOBILIARY:  FATTY AND ENLARGED LIVER.  48 year old female with Cushings syndrome.  1.

Non- Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL) usually presents as a localized or generalized adenopathy, although in one third of cases the disease may be primary in other sites where lymphoid tissue is located such as the oropharyngeal region, gut, bone marrow, and skin. All lymphomas have the potential to metastasize to other lymph nodes and eventually to infiltrate the spleen, bone marrow, and liver. If the disease spreads to the blood the patients peripheral blood will resemble that of a leukemic patient. CT findings of NHL include multiple enlarged individual nodes and coalescence of enlarged nodes to form rounded multilobular masses which may encase vessels, displace organs, and obstruct ureters. Conglomerate nodal masses are typical of lymphoma and are rarely seen in other diseases.

The patient has a history of distal pancreatectomy secondary to pseudocyst formation.  There is a 3.4 x 5.0 cm mass within the head of the pancreas. Within this mass there are some cystic areas with calcifications. This mass protrudes into the lumen of the duodenum near the junction of the second and third portions. There are multiple adjacent lymph nodes. There is a 1.2 x 2.2 cm node anterior to the head of the pancreas along the greater curve of the stomach. Also, there is a 1 x 1 cm aortocaval node posterior to the head of the pancreas. There are multiple other smaller lymph nodes anterior and inferior to the pancreas. There has been a distal pancreatectomy (history of pseudocyst in the past).  This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass;however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs or the SMA, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

Normal anatomical positioning is termed situs solitus. The cardiac apex, aortic arch, and stomach are all normally on the left. In addition, the anatomic left atrium is on the same side as the hyparterial bronchus and bilobed lung; the anatomic right atrium is on the same side as the eparterial bronchus and trilobed lung. With normal situs and levocardia, the incidence of congenital heart disease is less than 1%; with dextrocardia, the incidence rises to 95%. As shown above, situs inversus is a mirror image of normal anatomy. In situs inversus totalis, the cardiac apex, stomach and aortic arch are all on the right. Situs inversus totalis is associated with a 5-10% incidence of congenital heart disease. Situs inversus with levocardia (right-sided stomach and left-sided heart) is associated with congenital heart disease in 95% of cases, but is very rare. Kartageners syndrome may also be seen in connection with situs inversus. Kartageners syndrome represents a triad of situs inversus (seen in 50% of cases), sinusitis, and bronchiectasis. The latter two parts of the triad are due to immotile or dysmotile cilia affecting the respiratory epithelium, auditory epithelium, and the sperm in males; therefore, hearing difficulties and infertility may also be found in this syndrome. Two other situs abnormalities are worth noting. Situs ambiguous with bilateral \"right-sidedness\" is known as Asplenia syndrome.

A 66 year old female with chest pain.  The ascending aorta and aortic arch appear normal. There is aortic dissection in the descending thoracic aorta beginning immediately distal to the arch and extending into the proximal abdominal aorta. The true lumen is compressed and false lumen is significantly thrombosed.  CT has to a large degree replaced arteriography in diagnosing aortic dissection and determining its type and location. The diagnosis is made by the demonstration of an intimal flap, displaced inward from the edge of the aorta and lying between the true and false channels. In Dailys classification, types A and B are described with type A being more common. Type A involves the ascending aorta and is usually treated surgically because of the potential for retrograde dissection. Type B involves the area distal to the left subclavian artery and is treated medically. CT is used for screening those with suspected aortic dissection and for follow-up of patients previously diagnosed with dissection. It should be performed with bolus contrast enhancement and dynamic scanning at three levels: (1) the aortic arch; (2) the proximal aortic root and descending aorta near the level of the pulmonary artery; (3) the more distal descending thoracic aorta. Newer helical CT scanners allow rapid scanning of the arch during bolus contrast injection eliminating the need for the \"three level scan\". Two passes can be made throught the aortic arch early in the contrast injection. In a patient with dissection, the intimal flap may be delineated by contrast filling both the true and false channels. One of the channels may fill slowly, thus requiring the use of images late in the sequence to make the diagnosis. A false channel that contains a clot may not opacify and in such a case, may be difficult to distinguish from a clot-filled atherosclerotic aneurysm. Dissections, however, are usually longer than clot-filled aneurysms and may produce an abrupt change in aortic caliber and thickening of the aortic wall. Streak artifacts due to wall motion or vascular pulsations may mimic an intimal flap. Streak artifacts are usually seen in the descending aorta adjacent to the left heart.

The most common reason for their occurrence is incompetent valves in the testicular veins. Most cases of varicoceles are benign and most occur on the left side. Occasionally bilateral varicoceles are present. The most common presenting symptom is infertility in men, with 40% of cases of infertility being associated with varicoceles. Ultrasound is useful for detecting varicoceles of all sizes and for excluding other causes of testicular masses. The definitive diagnosis can be made by demonstrating the increase in size with increased abdominal pressure.

Visualized portions of liver and spleen are unremarkable in appearance without any focal lesion. Both adrenals, kidneys as well as the rest of the intra-abdominal bowel loops are unremarkable. There is no evidence of intestinal obstruction or free air evident.  Colorectal adenocarcinoma is one of the most common neoplasms encountered in the affluent countries of the Western world. The disease exhibits a peak age incidence in the sixth and seventh decades. It is associated with increased serum concentration of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Predisposing factors for colorectal cancer include adenomatous polyps, inherited multiple polyposis syndromes, long-standing ulcerative colitis, close relatives with colon cancer, and a low fiber, high animal fat diet. Colorectal cancer varies in gross presentation according to the region of the colon involved. Carcinoma of the rectosigmoid colon usually presents in an annular manner, often producing early bowel obstruction. Carcinoma of the right colon, however, usually does not obstruct early and frequently presents with iron deficiency anemia secondary to chronic blood loss. Colon cancer spreads by direct extension due to penetration of the colon wall, lymphatic drainage to regional nodes, through the portal system to the liver, and intraperitoneal seeding. Although barium enemas and colonoscopy are the primary methods used to initially diagnose colorectal cancer, CT is an excellent procedure for the detection of recurrence. CT findings of colon cancer include focal lobulated soft tissue mass in the colon, localized thickening of greater than 5 mm of the bowel wall, irregular lumen surface, extension of linear soft tissue densities or discrete mass into pericolic fat or adjacent organs, regional adenopathy, and liver metastases.

This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass;however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs or the SMA, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

Abdominal aortic aneurysms usually occur in the setting of atherosclerotic disease but may be caused by syphilis, by extension of a dissection from above, or by connective tissue disorders such as Takayasus arteritis. Complications of abdominal aortic aneurysm include rupture, peripheral embolization, thrombosis, and infection. The incidence of rupture increases with increasing aneurysm size above 4cm. Rupture usually occurs into the left retroperitoneal space and rarely into the gastrointestinal tract or inferior vena cava. If a ruptured or leaking aneurysm is suspected, a CT scan of the abdomen should be done with contrast enhancement. Typical findings include obscuration or anterior displacement of the aneurysm by an irregular high density mass or collection that extends into one or both perirenal spaces. The wall of the aneurysm may be identified by calcifications while the lumen enhances.

The patient is a 59 year old black male with alcoholic cirrhosis and known hepatocellular carcinoma.  The study is compared with prior CT exam. The liver again has a cirrhotic configuration and there is now an 8 x 12 cm heterogeneous mass present in the medial segment of the left hepatic lobe. A smaller, 2 x 3 cm, hypodense lesion is also noted to be present in the posterior aspect of the lateral segment of the left hepatic lobe. Portal vein occlusion is present with cavernous transformation. Splenomegaly is again noted with a large number of splenorenal, splenogastric and esophageal varices. The enlarged spleen and varices displace the left kidney as on previous exam. The gallbladder wall is edematous without evidence of pericholecystic fluid.  Liver cirrhosis is characterized by a generalized disorganization of hepatic archictecture with scarring and nodule formation. Other sequelae include liver cell damage, regenerative activity, and generalized fibrosis resulting in a nodular pattern. There is an increased incidence of hepatocelluar carcinoma associated with cirrhosis of the liver. Causes of cirrhosis include prolonged alcohol intake, viral hepatitis, biliary obstruction, Wilsons disease, and heart failure with long-standing chronic passive congestion of the liver. Alcoholic (Laennecs, nutritional) cirrhosis is the most frequently occurring form of the disorder. Clinical manifestations of the disease include jaundice, hypoalbuminemia, coagulation factor deficiencies, hyperstrinism, and intrahepatic scarring with increased portal venous pressure. The increase in portal venous pressure can lead to esophageal varices, rectal hemorrhiods, periumbilical venous collaterals (caput medusae), and splenomegaly. Morphologically, the liver may be enlarged or small and shrunken depending upon the progression of the disease. The nodular pattern is most often micronodular in alcoholic cirrhosis. Hepatic architecture is obscured by fibrous bands surrounding nodules of distorted liver cell plates. The fibrous bands contain proliferating bile ducts and inflammatory cells. In the final stages of cirrhosis the nodules become larger and more irregular resulting in a scarred, shrunken liver referred to as a \"hobnail liver\". Patients with cirrhosis of the liver often present with the following radiological findings. Fatty infiltration with hepatomegaly can be seen in the early stages of cirrhosis. Other characteristic findings include non-uniform attenuation due to chronic fatty infiltration and irregular fibrosis, irregular lobulated hepatic contour due to areas of atrophy and nodular regeneration, intrahepatic regenerating nodules, atrophy of the right lobe and hypertrophy of the left and caudate lobes, decreased liver volume accompanying chronic cirrhosis, increased size and prominence of the intrahepatic fissure due to shrunken liver parenchyma, signs of portal hypertension, and ascites. A ratio comparing the sizes of the caudate lobe and right lobe is a good diagnostic indicator of patients with cirrhosis. The caudate is measured transversely from the medial aspect of the caudate to the lateral aspect of the main portal vein. The right lobe is measured from this same point at the portal vein to the right lateral margin of the liver. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio greater than 0.65 provides 96% confidence in the diagnosis of cirrhosis. A caudate-to-right-lobe ratio less then 0.6 makes cirrhosis unlikely, whereas a ratio of 0.37 is the average for normal livers.", "image_path": ["00133513.jpg"], "split": "test"}, {"id": "00135458.jpg", "report": "RADIOLOGY: GENITOURINARY: GU:  BLADDER EXTROPHY", "image_path": ["00135458.jpg"], "split": "test"}, {"id": "00135175.jpg", "report": "RADIOLOGY: GASTROINTESTINAL: GI:  SMALL BOWEL INTUSSUSCEPTION.  33 year old female with history of mononucleosis recently.

Serial studies can also detect transformation of low grade astrocytomas to higher grades. Careful registration of PET with anatomical studies such as CT/ MRI is vital to proper interpretation because; 1) variations in metabolism seen commonly within tumors can complicate edge definition between normal and abnormal tissue on PET images; and 2) metabolic activity of a tumor is graded relative to the surrounding normal tissue which is better depicted with MRI/CT.

This is a 62 year old male who is three years status post right radical nephrectomy for a renal cell carcinoma.

Pre-contrast images through the liver demonstrate a 2 x 1.5cm low attenuation mass inferiorly and posteriorly which was identified on the previous CT and a 4 x 4cm low attenuation mass within the posterior segment of the right lobe not previously identified. The 4cm mass shows intense but fairly homogenous peripheral enhancement with central low attenuation. Delayed images through the liver show central filling of the large mass. The smaller mass is not visible on post contrast images. The appearance of the small lesion is grossly unchanged from the prior study when it was thought to be a hemangioma.  The liver is a common site for the metastatic spread of malignant tumors. Metatstatic lesions are the most common malignant tumor of the liver. Most arise from the colon, although they may originate from almost any primary malignancy. Liver metastases are usually multiple, well-defined, low density solid masses. When there is fatty infiltration, the masses may appear as high density solid masses. When the tumor is mucinous colon or ovarian carcinoma, melanoma, lung, or carcinoid, the tumor may have a cystic or necrotic appearance. Metastatic lesions may also be calcified. A solitary metastatic lesion may present a problem in differentiation. Thus it is necessary to consider the other possibilities such as hepatoma, hepatic adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, and cavernous hemangioma. Cavernous hemangiomas are the second most common focal mass found in the liver. They are usually asyptomatic, however when very large, may cause symptoms by pressure effect, hemorrhage, or arteriovenous shunting. The classic CT findings include a well-defined hypodense mass of same density of other blood-filled spaces, the development of nodule-like areas of enhancement from the periphery following administration of a bolus of contrast, areas of enhancement become confluent and isodense of hyperdense relative to the liver parenchyma, prolonged retention of contrast material, persisting within the lesion for 20 to 30 minutes, and discrete areas of fibrosis and calcification which remain hypodense throughtout the enhancement period.", "image_path": ["00133338.jpg"], "split": "test"}, {"id": "00137424.jpg", "report": "RADIOLOGY: GENITOURINARY: GU:  RENAL DONOR EVALUATION.  52 year-old female for renal donor evaluation.", "image_path": ["00137424.jpg"], "split": "test"}, {"id": "00135831.jpg", "report": "RADIOLOGY: ABDOMEN:  VERY LARGE VARACES.  57 year old female with hepatitis-C.  1.

Hepatocellular carcinoma usually appears as a hypodense or isodense lesion on nonenhanced images and enhances prominently during the arterial phase on dynamic contrast injection. Areas of tumor necrosis and calcification are common. Tumor invasion of hepatic and portal veins occurs frequently causing thrombosis of these vessels. Portal vein thrombosis may be accompanied by portal hypertension and its manifestations such as formation of collaterals, splenomegaly, and ascites. Portal vein thrombosis is readily diagnosed by CT and is best visualized with the incremental dynamic imaging technique. Acutely, the involved vessel enlarges, and the vessel wall may appear thickened and enhanced. There may be a small amount of contrast passing around the thrombus. The vessel itself has a relatively low central density. Serial examinations may show a change in the location or extent of thrombus, recanalization of the vessel, or retraction of the thrombus with collateral vein enlargement. Evidence of cavernous transformation of the portal vein may be seen as marked dilation of the periportal collaterals.

There is a very large abdominal aortic aneurysm which begins between the origin of the superior mesenteric artery and the renal artery and extends into the aortic bifurcation to involve the right common iliac artery. At its greatest dimensions, it measures 15.0 cm x 10.0 cm and contains a large amount of intramural thrombus. The aortic aneurysm is eccentric in location, residing more in the right side of the retroperitoneum. There is a moderate amount of hemorrhage within the right side of the retroperitoneum surrounding the aneurysm consistent with subacute hemorrhage. No active arterial extravasation is identified at this time.  Abdominal aortic aneurysms usually occur in the setting of atherosclerotic disease but may be caused by syphilis, by extension of a dissection from above, or by connective tissue disorders such as Takayasus arteritis. Complications of abdominal aortic aneurysm include rupture, peripheral embolization, thrombosis, and infection. The incidence of rupture increases with increasing aneurysm size above 4cm. Rupture usually occurs into the left retroperitoneal space and rarely into the gastrointestinal tract and inferior vena cava. If a ruptured or leaking aneurysm is suspected, CT should be done with contrast enhancement. Typical findings include obscuration or anterior displacement of the aneurysm by an irregular high density mass or collection that extends into one or both perirenal spaces. The wall of the aneurysm may be identified by calcifications while the lumen enhances. Other findings include anterior displacement of the kidney by hematoma, enlargement or obscuration of the psoas muscle, and a focally indistinct aortic margin that corresponds to the site of rupture.

The aortic arch and descending throacic aorta are on the right. The stomach is right-sided and the liver is left-sided. There is a single spleen on the right.  Normal anatomical positioning is termed situs solitus. The cardiac apex, aortic arch, and stomach are all normally on the left. In addition, the anatomic left atrium is on the same side as the hyparterial bronchus and bilobed lung; the anatomic right atrium is on the same side as the eparterial bronchus and trilobed lung. With normal situs and levocardia, the incidence of congenital heart disease is less than 1%; with dextrocardia, the incidence rises to 95%. As shown above, situs inversus is a mirror image of normal anatomy. In situs inversus totalis, the cardiac apex, stomach and aortic arch are all on the right. Situs inversus totalis is associated with a 5-10% incidence of congenital heart disease. Situs inversus with levocardia (right-sided stomach and left-sided heart) is associated with congenital heart disease in 95% of cases, but is very rare. Kartageners syndrome may also be seen in connection with situs inversus. Kartageners syndrome represents a triad of situs inversus (seen in 50% of cases), sinusitis, and bronchiectasis. The latter two parts of the triad are due to immotile or dysmotile cilia affecting the respiratory epithelium, auditory epithelium, and the sperm in males; therefore, hearing difficulties and infertility may also be found in this syndrome. Two other situs abnormalities are worth noting. Situs ambiguous with bilateral \"right-sidedness\" is known as Asplenia syndrome.

There are clips in the gallbladder bed consistent with previous cholecystectomy. The left adrenal gland appears thickened.  This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass;however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs or the SMA, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.

Colorectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death in the United States. It appears to be associated with diets high in animal fat and protein and low in fiber. Seventy percent of colorectal cancers occur in the rectosigmoid region. Rectal cancers may present with bleeding, change in bowel habits, perineal pain, and symptoms of invasion of adjacent organs including hematuria, urinary frequency, or vaginal fistulas. Surgical removal is the only effective therapy. Anterior resection with anastomosis to the rectal stump is performed for upper rectal tumors and a combined abdominal and perineal resection with a permanent colostomy for distal rectal lesions. On CT, rectal lesions may appear as focal lobulated soft tissue masses with asymmetrical or circumferential thickening of the bowel wall. Narrowing of the lumen and bowel obstruction may be evident. Extension into pericolonic fat or adjacent structures, regional adenopathy, adrenal or liver metastases, and hydronephrosis may also be visualized. Common sites of local extension include the pelvic musculature, bladder, prostate, ovaries, and seminal vesicles.

This is a 47 year old white female without significant prior medical history, who presents with three weeks of nausea with new onset of jaundice.  There is intrahepatic biliary and pancreatic duct dilatation. An enhancing 3 x 3 x 4 cm pancreatic head mass is identified. The mass abuts the right lateral surface of the superior mesenteric vein, but there is apparent preservation of a separating fat plane. The superior mesenteric artery, portal vein, and IVC are patent and show no evidence of encasement. A single 12 mm lymph node is identified within the porta. No other retroperitoneal adenopathy is seen. In the lateral segment of the left hepatic lobe is a 7mm hypodense lesion which is suspicious for metastatic disease. An ill defined low density lesion may also be present in the posterior segment of the right hepatic lobe. The gastrohepatic ligament is free of adenopathy.  This almost uniformly fatal cancer is the 4th most common malignant tumor accounting for 5% of cancer deaths in the United States. Symptoms are usually nonspecific and insidious such that the cancer is advanced by the time of diagnosis. Most cancers occur in the head of the pancreas and are usually adenocarcinomas arising from ductal cells. The sensitivity of CT scan in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma is approximately 95% whereas that of ultrasound is less than 80% for cancer of the head and 40% for the tail. The primary finding on CT is a focal mass;however, if no mass is present, other findings may suggest neoplasm. First, the pancreas may become more heterogeneous in density with age. Thus, a focal region of homogeneous soft tissue density might raise suspicion of a carcinoma. The presence of both a dilated common bile duct and a dilated main pancreatic duct in the absence of calculus suggests ampullary or pancreatic head neoplasm, but this may also be seen in benign disease. The finding of a dilated main pancreatic duct in the body or tail but not in the head or neck suggests neoplasm, and finally, the finding of rounded convex borders of both anterior and posterior surfaces of the uncinate process raises suspicion for carcinoma. Ten to fifteen percent of patients will have potentially resectable tumors, and they may be distinguished by CT findings. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilatation of the bile and pancreatic ducts and combined bile-pancreatic duct dilatation without an identifiable pancreatic mass. Extension of the tumor beyond the margins of the pancreas, involvement of adjacent organs, liver metastases, ascites, and regional adenopathy are signs of unresectability.
